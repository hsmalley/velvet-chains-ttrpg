# Velvet Chains & Voidlight Codex

Welcome to the cartographic archive for the **Velvet Chains & Voidlight** campaign setting—a neon‑wreathed, consent‑forward space‑pirate melodrama where every soulmark has a story and the safe word is **fiction**. This repository powers the public documentation site built with Astro Starlight, collecting characters, companions, adventures, factions, places, and maps for the table.

## ✨ Core Themes

- **Consent is canon** – Rituals, clauses, and Drama Points reward respectful negotiation and theatrical creativity.
- **Neon corsair aesthetics** – Dark romance gradients, glowing typography, and Voidlight sigils shine through the custom theme.
- **Living archive** – Content lives under `src/content/docs/**` and automatically renders into routes, search, and spotlight sections.

> **Note:** The top-level symlinks mirror the content folders for convenience in Obsidian. On Windows or non-symlink-friendly environments you can delete them and work directly in `src/content/docs/**`.

## 🛠️ Authoring Workflow

1. **Clone the repository** and (optionally) open it as an Obsidian vault. The `.obsidian/` directory contains a lightweight workspace profile.
2. **Use the templates** in `obsidian-templates/` when creating a new character, companion, faction, adventure, place, or map. Copy the file into the matching directory and replace the `{{...}}` placeholders.
3. **Follow the schema** defined in `src/content.config.ts`. Required frontmatter is enforced by the validator.
4. **Run validation** before committing: `npm run validate:content`.
5. **Build locally** with `npm run build` (validation runs automatically) or preview with `npm run dev`.

## 🧪 Quality Gates

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run check:safeword`   | Warns when a document forgets to invoke the sacred safe word |
| `npm run validate:content` | Validates MD/MDX frontmatter against the campaign schema |
| `npm run build`            | Runs validation then builds the Starlight site into `dist/` |
| `npm run dev`              | Starts the local dev server at `http://localhost:4321` |

CI mirrors this ritual through `.github/workflows/content-check.yml`, ensuring every PR keeps the codex in balance.

## 🚀 Deployment

The **Deploy Velvet Codex to Pages** workflow (`.github/workflows/astro.yml`) publishes the site to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`. Manual dispatches are supported for emergency Voidlight rituals.

## 🕯️ Theming

The bespoke CSS in `src/styles/velvet-chains-theme.css` imports the same fonts and gradients as the primary **velvet-chains** project. Feel free to extend the palette or add new callout variants; the stylesheet is intentionally unlayered so it overrides Starlight defaults.

Want the same aesthetic in your editor? Copy the entire `obsidian-theme/` folder into your vault’s `.obsidian/themes/` directory (renaming it to `velvet-chains-voidlight` keeps everything tidy) and select **Velvet Chains & Voidlight** inside Obsidian. For bonus customisation, enable the **Style Settings** plugin to tweak accents, glow, and background animation.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Run `npm install` followed by `npm run prepare` once to install the pre-commit hooks.
3. Add or edit content/templates/components.
4. Run `npm run validate:content` and `npm run build`.
5. Open a PR. Share highlights in the commit message—hedonistic theatrics encouraged.

Remember: call the safe word if boundaries shift, celebrate every Drama Point, and let your stories shimmer with Voidlight.
