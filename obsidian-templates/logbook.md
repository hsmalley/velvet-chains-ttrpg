## 🎭 Hope Pulse

Record table-wide surges in Hope dice or notable moments of empathy.  
Note how consent or collaboration shifted the campaign tone and when Danger threatened to crash through.

Map these swings to Hope spent or gained, Strings exchanged, scars soothed, or new complications discovered.
