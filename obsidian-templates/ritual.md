Consent, Hope, or Pulse may substitute for rolls. Detail materials, offerings, or risks. Describe
backlash if vows or conditions fail.

---

## 💫🔥 𝘌𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵

Describe the outcome—how it changes the scene, shifts Hope/Danger, or alters Strings. Use symbolic
or mechanical language.

---

## 💀🔥 𝘍𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘶𝘳𝘦 & 𝘉𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘩

Explain what happens when the ritual falters. Scars, stress, corruption, or narrative twists may
emerge.

---

## 🌈🔥 𝘊𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘚𝘶𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴

Describe the extraordinary outcome when everything aligns. This might be radiant change, lasting
mark, or mythic consequence.

---

## 🧩🔥 𝘜𝘴𝘢𝘨𝘦 & 𝘚𝘺𝘮𝘣𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘮

- **When to Cast:** {{moments of tension, need, or transformation}}
- **Meaning:** {{the vow it represents, the effect it enacts}}
- **Cultural Origin:** {{who created or practices this rite}}

---

## 🎆🔥 Bombastic Mode (Optional)

When modest notes fail, unleash Bombastic Mode. Describe the appendix with operatic excess and grand
spectacle:

- Overwrought metaphors and cosmic exaggerations.
- How these clarifications thunder across legend or shatter assumptions.
- What impossible promises, scandals, or revelations it embodies.

Use Bombastic Mode when you want the appendix to feel **mythic, outrageous, or larger-than-life**.
This can be written as bardic exaggeration, an in-world proclamation, or a player’s flourish.
