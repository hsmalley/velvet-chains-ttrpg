## 🎆🔥 Bombastic Mode (Optional)

When subtlety is not enough, invoke Bombastic Mode. Describe the artifact with maximum
theatricality:

- Overwrought metaphors and cosmic exaggeration.
- How it thunders across legend and ruptures reality.
- What impossible promises or cataclysms it embodies.

Use Bombastic Mode when you want the artifact to feel **mythic, operatic, or larger-than-life**.
This can be written as an outrageous in-world tale, a bard’s exaggeration, or a player’s flourish.
