## 🪐 AGENT PROCLAMATION

> ⚙️ “This entanglement is no mere subplot — it is a COLLISION ENGINE of passion, betrayal, and
> destiny!” 🏴‍☠️ Bombast Protocol engaged. Emotional gravity wells incoming. ✨⛓️🔥

---

## 🪞🔥 Entanglement Core

Describe the fundamental tension: rivalry, romance, or both.

- What oath, vow, or betrayal lies at the center?
- What does each side _want_ from the other that they cannot surrender?

---

## ⚔️🔥 Duel of Vows

Define how conflicts play out between the two:

- **Kiss Duel** (Heart)
- **Blade Duel** (Pulse)
- **Oath Duel** (Mind)

Each generates Scars or Strings.

---

## 🎭🔥 Hope & Strings Resonance

What moments cause Strings to multiply? What triggers shared Hope, or collapse into Danger?

---

## 🩸🔥 Shared Scars

Record scars, wounds, or emotional burns both carry from their encounters. Use them as reroll
tokens, Hope costs, or narrative prompts.

---

## 🌹🔥 Dramatic Escalation Table

Roll d8 or improvise when tension peaks. Examples: kiss mid-duel, oath shouted to the void, forced
alliance, revelation of a forgotten vow.

---

## 🎆🔥 Bombastic Mode

Describe what happens when melodrama is unleashed at full volume. Overblown metaphors, impossible
feats, cosmic-scale consequences.

---

## 🪞🔥 Codex Resonance

> ✨⛓️ What hues, vows, or echoes define the bond? How does the void remember them?

---

## 🕯️🔥 Codex Invocation

Describe the mantra or ritual both declare — together or against each other.

> ✨⛓️🔥 The reflection endures, whether as doom, destiny, or both.
