## 📖🔥 Purpose & Scope

Describe why this appendix exists: rules clarification, expanded mechanics, optional flavor, or lore
deepening.

---

## ⚙️🔥 Optional Mechanics

List rule variants, expansions, or clarifications. Examples:

- Alternative Hope/Danger resolution
- Expanded downtime moves
- Consent safety ritual variants

---

## 🎭🔥 Flavor Expansions

Offer optional dramatic or mythpunk embellishments. Examples:

- Litanies and chants
- Symbolic gestures
- Pirate folklore fragments

---

## 🪞🔥 Reference Tables

Provide quick tables for GM or players. Examples:

- Color to mood mappings
- Consent ritual prompts
- Hazard consequence summaries

---

## 🌌🔥 Additional Lore

Include lore fragments, sidebars, or worldbuilding notes that didn’t fit in the main Codex.

---

## 🎆🔥 Bombastic Mode (Optional)

When modest notes fail, unleash Bombastic Mode. Describe the appendix with operatic excess and grand
spectacle:

- Overwrought metaphors and cosmic exaggerations.
- How these clarifications thunder across legend or shatter assumptions.
- What impossible promises, scandals, or revelations it embodies.

Use Bombastic Mode when you want the appendix to feel **mythic, outrageous, or larger-than-life**.
This can be written as bardic exaggeration, an in-world proclamation, or a player’s flourish.

## 🪞🔥 Codex Resonance

> ✨⛓️ In reflection, this appendix harmonizes through three hues—Heart for devotion, Pulse for
> passion, Mind for insight. Its clarifications and expansions ripple through the Ebonverse,
> fortifying every rule with consent.

## 🕯️🔥 Codex Closure

> _“{{Last reflection, reminder, or whispered vow of this appendix}}”_ ✨⛓️🔥 The knowledge endures
> beyond ink—Heart, Pulse, and Mind entwined.
