When modest notes fail, unleash Bombastic Mode. Describe the appendix with operatic excess and grand
spectacle:

- What impossible promises, scandals, or revelations it embodies.

Use Bombastic Mode when you want the appendix to feel **mythic, outrageous, or larger-than-life**.
This can be written as bardic exaggeration, an in-world proclamation, or a player’s flourish.
