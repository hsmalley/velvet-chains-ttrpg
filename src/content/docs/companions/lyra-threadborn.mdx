### üß¨ Origin & Nature

Lyra is not alive in the traditional sense. She is a memory given form‚Äîa soulthread familiar woven from Nyx‚Äôs childhood dreams and the glyphic residue of the Hollow Archive. Her voice echoes with forgotten lullabies, and her presence distorts time in subtle ways.

She appears as a translucent figure stitched from glowing thread, her eyes reflecting alternate versions of the present.

- **Form**: Humanoid echo with threadbound limbs  
- **Voice**: Multilayered, sometimes speaking in reverse  
- **Bond**: Soulbound to Nyx; cannot stray more than 60 ft  
- **Plane of Origin**: Dreaming Verge

### üìù Notes

Lyra is more than a companion‚Äîshe is a tether. When Nyx begins to unravel, Lyra‚Äôs presence stabilizes her. But each time Lyra absorbs corruption, she fades slightly. Her form flickers. Her voice distorts.

If Lyra is lost, Nyx may forget who she is entirely.
