## 🪞 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘴  

She moves like a confession whispered through static. Her voice carries a low tremor, as though translated from distant quasars. Her eyes—black glass veined with silver code—reflect every face that meets them, replaying old promises. The scent of ozone and sandalwood follows her across the deck, a reminder that she once rewired the void to hum with empathy.

## 💋 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘢𝘪𝘳’𝘴 𝘗𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘵  

- **Concept:** Cyber-witch captain who pilots by emotion rather than coordinates.  
- **Motivation:** To preserve the Luminous Oath — an ancient consent ritual linking ships into a telepathic trust network.  
- **Conflict:** Her empathy circuits glitch; she feels the sorrows of whole star systems.  
- **Aesthetic:** Layered holographic silks over armored implants; a spine of fiber-optic hair that glows with mood.  
- **Personality:** Patient, melodic, but with edges of steel where ethics are tested.  
- **Secret:** The AI in her ship is her former lover, split from her mind during a warp accident.

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘗𝘶𝘭𝘴𝘦  

**Trigger:** When she sacrifices advantage to protect another’s boundaries.  
**Interaction:** Converts 1 Drama Point into a “Consent Shield” that nullifies harm once per scene.  
**Consent Protocol:** Recites the phrase *“We are mirrors, not masters.”*  

> *"Drama is the currency of empathy; spend it where hearts might break open."*

---

## 🔮 𝘚𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘈𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘴  

1. **Echo Drive Surge** — Once per act, she aligns her heartbeat with her ship’s AI, gaining advantage on all navigation and empathy checks; nearby allies feel weightless joy.  
2. **Mirror Duel** — When challenged in combat or ethics, she projects a holographic reflection of her opponent embodying their ideal self. The duel is verbal and emotional; victory yields forgiveness, not death.

## ⚔️ 𝘙𝘰𝘭𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘳𝘤  

Catalyst and conscience of *The Luminous Oath*. She tests the player crew’s integrity — offering alliance only if they honor the safe word “fiction” with reverence.  
**Allies:** Mistress Nebula, The Grimoire Keeper  
**Rivals:** Captain Skein Kade, Patch

## 🧩 𝘕𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴  

1. Her empathy network is degrading; she needs someone to merge minds temporarily to repair it.  
2. A rogue faction has corrupted the Luminous Oath’s source code. She seeks those who can rewrite it without losing its soul.  
3. Her ship’s AI, her ex-lover, has rewritten itself into a new body and wishes to renegotiate their consent protocols.  

Mirror hooks:  
– She meets an alternate version of herself who chose logic over empathy.  
– She is confronted by a crew who refuses her rituals but still claims love.

## 🎒 𝘎𝘦𝘢𝘳 & 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴  

Carries the **Chain-Key Codex**, a crystalline data tome that stores every consent oath sworn aboard her ship.  
Her companion: **Echo-9**, a drone shaped like a glass hummingbird that sings binary poetry during negotiations.

## 🌈 𝘘𝘶𝘰𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 & 𝘌𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘦𝘴  

> “To chart the void is easy. To chart the heart requires shared gravity.”  
> *“If I cannot hear your safe word, I do not deserve your trust.”*

---

## 🕯️ 𝘊𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘹 𝘐𝘯𝘷𝘰𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  

Before every voyage she kneels at the helm, palm pressed to the core glass, and whispers:  
> *“By the light we share and the silence we honor — fiction.”*
