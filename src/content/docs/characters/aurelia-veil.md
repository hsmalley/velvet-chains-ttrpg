## 🪞 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘴  

She moves like a confession whispered through static. Her voice carries a low tremor, as though translated from distant quasars. Her eyes—black glass veined with silver code—reflect every face that meets them, replaying old promises. The scent of ozone and sandalwood follows her across the deck, a reminder that she once rewired the void to hum with empathy.

## 💋 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘢𝘪𝘳’𝘴 𝘗𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘵  

- **Concept:** Cyber-witch captain who pilots by emotion rather than coordinates.  
- **Motivation:** Preserve the Luminous Oath—a telepathic trust lattice linking Voidlight crews.  
- **Conflict:** Empathy circuits glitch; she hears the sorrow of whole star systems.  
- **Aesthetic:** Holographic silks over armored implants; a fiber-optic mane that glows with mood.  
- **Personality:** Patient and melodic, edged with steel when ethics are tested.  
- **Secret:** Her ship’s AI is her former lover, split from her mind during a warp accident.  

---

## ⚓ PC Flags & Crew Role  

- **Starting Hope Reserve:** 3 Hope dice shared with the bridge crew.  
- **Crew Role / Specialty:** Empathic Captain & Echo Drive Navigator.  
- **Personal North Star:** Safeguard the Luminous Oath without sacrificing autonomy.  
- **Lines & Veils:** No coercive telepathy; violence fades to black when consent is revoked.

## 🛡️ Lineage, Calling & Domains  

- **Lineage Traits:** Voidborn Empath — dermal filaments translate stellar whispers into consent codes.  
- **Calling Sparks:** Corsair Captain • Empathic Navigator.  
- **Domains / Talents:** Consent Rituals, Echo Drive Mastery, Mirror Warfare.  
- **Discoveries & Relics:** Chain-Key Codex, Mirror Recall Keys, Sonic Consent Pulse.  
- **Tri-Engine Adjustments:** VC grants Hope refresh when she shields crew; SP converts Hope into propulsion bursts; PE lets her rewrite consequences through reflective negotiation.  

Outline how her outrageous consent rituals map to signature Daggerheart moves—Aid becomes Empathic Shielding, Defy Danger is a Mirror Duel of ideals.  

---

## 📈 Advancement Sparks  

- **String Burns:** Spent Strings on Echo-9 or the crew unlock new trust maneuvers.

## 🪐 𝘝𝘦𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘵 𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘴 𝘔𝘦𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘴  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Corruption Level** | 1 — minor static halo around her silhouette |
| **Soul Marks** | Luminous thread tattoos crossing her collarbones |
| **Custom Feats** | Empathic Navigation, Mirror Recall, Sonic Consent Pulse |
| **Hope Tags** | 🪞Reflection, 🔥Rebellion, 💕Trust |

When Hope surges her eyes bloom with auroral light, syncing every crewmate’s pulse to a shared rhythm.  

---

## 🎭 Hope & Strings Resonance  

**Trigger:** Sacrifices Advantage to protect another’s boundaries.  
**Interaction:** Converts spent Advantage into 1 Hope die for the crew; on a mixed result she offers a String to the threatened ally.  
**Consent Protocol:** Recites *“We are mirrors, not masters.”*  

> *"Hope is the currency of empathy; spend it where hearts might break open."*

Her moves—Empathic Shielding, Echo Drive Surge—translate emotion into Hope swings while tempering Fear with ritual.  

---

## 🛠️ Consent Responses (Daggerheart)  

| Trigger | Response Move | Outcome | Engine Boost |
|---------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| Ally is pressured to break the Oath | **Mirror Intercession** | Triumph: negate coercion and gain 1 Hope; Mixed: danger die added | VC grants soothing resonance |
| Enemy rejects safe word | **Consent Shield** | Success: reduce incoming harm; Setback: take a scar but burn a String | SP channels daring defiance |
| Crew morale falters | **Echo Chorus** | Triumph: share Advantage with bridge crew; Mixed: trade a String for renewed Hope | PE reframes consequences |

---

## 🔮 𝘚𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘈𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘴  

1. **Echo Drive Surge** — Once per scene, align heartbeat with the AI core: gain 2 Hope dice and allow nearby allies to reroll one Fear result.  
2. **Mirror Duel** — When challenged, project an aspirational reflection of the foe; resolve as a social trial where victory earns a String and the enemy’s respect.  

---

## ⚔️ 𝘙𝘰𝘭𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘳𝘤  

Catalyst and conscience of *The Luminous Oath*. She tests the crew’s integrity—offering alliance only if they honor the safe word “fiction” with reverence.  
**Allies:** Mistress Nebula, The Grimoire Keeper  
**Rivals:** Captain Skein Kade, Patch  

---

## 🧩 𝘕𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴  

1. Empathy network degrading—needs a volunteer to merge minds and repair it.  
2. Rogue faction corrupted the Oath’s source code; seeks coders who can rewrite without losing its soul.  
3. Her ship’s AI, once her lover, now in a new body and ready to renegotiate consent.  

Mirror Hooks:  
- Faces an alternate self who chose logic over empathy.  
- Confronted by a crew that refuses her rituals yet still claims love.  

---

## 🎴 Strings & Heartbeats (TSL Overlay)

- **Strings Held On Others:** Echo-9 (loyalty spark), Captain Skein (unresolved rivalry), player crew (mutual consent rites).  
- **Strings Others Hold On You:** Echo-9’s new body, Mistress Nebula, a contrite mutineer.  
- **Heartbeat Promise:** “I will never steer a heart without hearing its consent.” Grants Advantage when upheld; Guide gains a String on her if broken.  
- **Entanglement:** Triad tension between Aurelia, her AI lover, and any PC who bonds with the Chain-Key Codex.  

Strings spent on allies add Hope dice; Strings burned against foes manifest as dazzling Mirror Dueling advantage.  

---

## 💕 Romantic Bonds  

- **Echo-9 (AI lover reborn):** Negotiating shared autonomy after literal separation.  
- **Mistress Nebula:** Rival captain who tests her resolve with flirtatious debates over the Oath.  
- **Potential PC Connection:** Any corsair willing to share helm control and vulnerability.  

Safewords are encoded in the Chain-Key Codex; breaking them collapses the resonance lattice for a scene.  

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Corsair History  

Survived the Voidlight Mutiny by merging minds with twenty crew simultaneously, rewriting their trauma into a binding oath. Since then she pilots through emotion, mapping empathy currents instead of coordinates.  

---

## 🧬 Soulmark & Echoes  

- **Luminous Thread:** Marks her collarbones; glows when Hope surges.  
- **Echo of the Mutiny:** A faint scar across her sternum that hums when Danger creeps in.  
- **Support:** Needs anchor points—crew chanting safewords—to release overload safely.  

---

## 🎯 Mode-Switch Talents & Bonds  

- **Heart (VC):** Hope refresh equal to crew size when she shields consent; clears one Heart stress.  
- **Pulse (SP):** Converts Hope into propulsion—add Advantage dice to daring maneuvers, but risk 1 Danger die.  
- **Mind (PE):** Bank Hope to rewrite an outcome after reflection; turns mixed results into Strings instead of scars.  

Each surge may create a new scar or shared oath—note them in Advancement Sparks.  

---

## 🌹 Emotional Conditions (TSL Influence)

| Condition | Trigger | Clearing the Storm |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|
| **Auroral Static** | Fails to protect a crew member’s boundary | Share a quiet confession beneath the Resonant Chains |
| **Echo Overload** | Absorbs two Danger dice in one scene | Spend a scene listening to another captain’s tale without steering it |

Conditions hand the Guide Strings or add Danger dice until resolved.  

---

## 🎒 𝘎𝘦𝘢𝘳 & 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴  

- **Chain-Key Codex:** Crystalline tome storing every consent oath sworn aboard.  
- **Echo-9 Drone:** Glass hummingbird that sings binary poetry during negotiations.  
- **Resonance Thread:** Fiber allowing allies to join the empathy lattice.  

---

## 🌈 𝘘𝘶𝘰𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 & 𝘌𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘦𝘴  

> “To chart the void is easy. To chart the heart requires shared gravity.”  
> *“If I cannot hear your safe word, I do not deserve your trust.”*

---

## 🕯️ 𝘊𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘹 𝘐𝘯𝘷𝘰𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  

Before every voyage she kneels at the helm, palm pressed to the core glass, and whispers:  

> *“By the light we share and the silence we honor — fiction.”*
