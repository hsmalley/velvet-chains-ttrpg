## 🪞 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘴  

Marlowe steps onto any stage as though it were judgment day. They speak in proclamations wrapped in velvet, each word punctuated by the clang of ceremonial boots. Metallic cords braid their coat; every knot marks an oath enforced, every tassel a dispute averted.

- **Concept:** Commanding corsair who believes strict codification prevents mutiny.  
- **Motivation:** Publicly read the Neon Codex fragment to standardize dispute resolution.  
- **Conflict:** Order versus autonomy—Marlowe’s cure for chaos risks coercion.  
- **Aesthetic:** Brass-rimmed coat, glowing sigil tattoos, ceremonial ropes coiled at the waist.  
- **Personality:** Theatrical, charismatic, and reluctant to cede the spotlight.  
- **Secret:** Hoards recordings of every failed negotiation to remind themself what fear looks like.

## ⚓ PC Flags & Crew Role  

- **Starting Hope Reserve:** 2 Hope dice tied to codex recitations.  
- **Crew Role / Specialty:** Codex Enforcer, Ritual Orator.  
- **Personal North Star:** “No crew should bleed because a clause was unclear.”  
- **Lines & Veils:** Refuses mental domination; humiliation scenes must remain consensual and performative.

Marlowe feeds on structured empathy—Hope rises when rivals respect the stage, but Danger builds if anyone breaks script.

2. **Corsair Phalanx** — Summons disciplined crew for nonlethal intervention, trading Hope for crowd control.  
3. **Token Ledger** — Remembers favors through tokens; cash one to give allies Advantage or impose a debt.  

---

## ⚔️ 𝘙𝘰𝘭𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘳𝘤  

Acts as political fulcrum within the Neon Bazaar. PCs can win the codified future by persuading Marlowe to revise their doctrine—or trigger a crackdown by pushing too hard.  

---

1. Debate Marlowe in public to redirect the Codex reading toward liberation.  
2. Offer an alternate enforcement plan to turn them into an ally.  
3. Expose the mutiny that traumatized them to unravel or heal their authority.

---

- **Lira Voss (Mediator):** Rivals-in-philosophy, lovers in secret debates.  
- **Captain Aurelia Veil:** Mutual respect laced with competition for moral authority.  
- **Potential PC Bond:** Anyone willing to craft a new clause publicly with them.  

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Corsair History  

Survived a mutiny early in their career; vowed never again to let ambiguous orders cost lives. The Neon Codex became scripture, and the stage their courtroom.  

---

## 🧬 Soulmark & Echoes  

- **Rope Scar:** Glows when a clause is violated.  
- **Voice of the Mutiny:** A phantom whisper that questions every decree.  
- Needs nightly rehearsals to bleed off Mind stress; without them, strings snap.  

---

## 🎯 Mode-Switch Talents & Bonds  

- **Heart (VC):** Grant Hope to allies who participate in ceremonial exchanges.  
- **Pulse (SP):** Spend Hope to intimidate without violence; risk gaining a Danger die if pride flares.  
- **Mind (PE):** Bank Hope to rewrite or add clauses post-scene; converts mixed results into new Strings instead of scars.  

---

## 🌹 Emotional Conditions  

| Condition | Trigger | Clearing the Storm |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|
| **Stage Fright** | An audience spurns their decree | Accept a compromise drafted by another |
| **Tightened Knot** | Adds two Danger dice without resolution | Share the ledger of past failures with someone trusted |
