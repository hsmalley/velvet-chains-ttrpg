# Lira Voss — Consent Coordinator (Patron)

**Name & Pronouns:** Lira Voss — she/they

**Role / Occupation:** Mediator, information broker, and proprietor of the Consent Lounge in the Neon Bazaar. Runs mediated bargaining sessions, notarizes Consent Codex readings, and trades secure rumors for dramatic tokens.

**Physical Description (Short phrases):**
- Tall, composed posture; always dressed in layered silks and a tailored negotiation vest.
- Soft, warm holo-eyes (augmented optics) that flicker lavender when listening.
- Fingers dotted with tiny inked sigils used to stamp tokens and validate oaths.
- Voice: calm, measured, theatrical cadence when officiating rituals.

**Personality & Quirk:**
- Poised and relentlessly kind; speaks in short, emphatic sentences when necessary.
- Performative restraint: organizes ritualized pauses (a dramatic bow, a bell) before every negotiation.
- Quirk: keeps a tiny notebook of micro-novellas inspired by disputes; reads a line to diffuse tension.

**Motivations:**
- Primary: prevent the Codex fragment from being weaponized and preserve Bazaar autonomy.
- Secondary: maintain social order through consensual ritual; increase public trust in mediated solutions.
- Personal: seeks to compile a master codex of consensual clauses and ceremonial recitations.

**Drama Point Trigger:**
- If PCs stage a respectful public ritual, recite a safe-word oath, or perform an improvised consent protocol, Lira awards 1 Drama Point and immediate goodwill (ally status).
- If players publicly mishandle consent (coercion), Lira withdraws access to mediation services and may deny future favors.

**Suggested Proficiencies / Mechanics (system-agnostic):**
- High Diplomacy/Negotiation, expert Society/Legal, trained Insight.
- Offers mediation bonus: +2 to Diplomacy checks if players agree to perform a negotiated ritual or spend a Consent Token.

**Secret or Plot Twist (Optional):**
- Lira once served a corporate arbitration council and still holds a ledger of off-the-books precedents—giving them leverage over certain factions if revealed.

**Roleplay Hooks / Uses for the PCs:**
- Patron for the retrieval mission; provides contacts and a safe-space to plan.
- Source of in-campaign rituals that grant Drama Points or social boons.
- Moral compass: will withhold help if PCs break the Bazaar’s consent codes.

**And remember, the safe word is _fiction_**
