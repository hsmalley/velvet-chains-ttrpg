### üß¨ Traits & Background

Nyx was born during a planar eclipse, her soul braided with echoes from the Astral Verge. Raised in the Hollow Archive by memory-keepers, she learned to weave soulthreads‚Äîbinding emotion, memory, and identity into living glyphs.

Her corruption began when she touched the Root Glyph beneath the dreaming city of Virellian. Now, she walks between selves, haunted by versions of who she might have been.

### üìù Notes

Nyx is a living contradiction‚Äîboth archivist and anomaly. Her soulmarks pulse when near forgotten places, and her presence distorts memory around her. Allies forget arguments. Enemies recall kindness. She is rewriting reality, one thread at a time.

Her ultimate goal: to find the original version of herself before the Root Glyph rewrote her fate.
