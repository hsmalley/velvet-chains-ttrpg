## 🪞 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘴

Nyx was born during a planar eclipse, soul braided with echoes from the Astral Verge. Glyphs shimmer
beneath her skin like constellation scars; each pulse is a memory fragment begging to be rewoven.

## 💋 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘢𝘪𝘳’𝘴 𝘗𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘵

- **Concept:** Soulweaver who binds emotion, memory, and identity into living glyphs.
- **Motivation:** Reclaim the original self before the Root Glyph rewrote her fate.
- **Conflict:** Haunted by alternate versions tugging at her decisions.
- **Aesthetic:** Flowing memory-thread robes, ink-stained fingers, lenses etched with dreamcatchers.
- **Personality:** Dreamy, mercurial, candid in sleepless hours.
- **Secret:** Keeps an echo of the Root Glyph hidden in a dreamcatcher lens.

---

## ⚓ PC Flags & Crew Role

- **Starting Hope Reserve:** 1 Hope die, 1 stored String from the Archive.
- **Crew Role / Specialty:** Soulweaver, Memory Cartographer.
- **Personal North Star:** “I will weave my own consent into every spell.”
- **Lines & Veils:** No rewriting memories without explicit agreement; no resurrection without a
  shared oath.
