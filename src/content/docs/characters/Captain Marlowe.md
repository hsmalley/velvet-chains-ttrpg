# Captain Marlowe "Skein" Kade — Rival Corsair Leader

**Name & Pronouns:** Captain Marlowe "Skein" Kade — they/them

**Role / Occupation:** Charismatic corsair captain and leader of a tightly-disciplined flotilla in the Spindle Belt. Seeks to read the Codex fragment publicly to enforce a strict, uniform “code” across salvage yards and small rimworld settlements.

**Physical Description (Short phrases):**
- Tall, angular frame; weathered, brass-rimmed monarchical coat with braided silken cords.
- Tattooed sigils along forearms that glow faintly when invoking ship rituals.
- Voice: booming, dramatic, used to addressing crowds; a smile that is both disarming and calculating.
- Movement: theatrical gestures—half-bow, half-threat.

**Personality & Quirk:**
- Theatrical and blunt; they speak in pronouncements and expect rules to be obeyed.
- Surprisingly principled about consent in the abstract—believes in order achieved through a single codified law.
- Quirk: collects ceremonial ropes from every port they pacify; uses them to bind the public oath scroll during readings.

**Motivations:**
- Primary: bring stability (their version) to the Spindle Belt by standardizing dispute resolution.
- Secondary: consolidate influence and attract more vessels to their code-enforcement fleet.
- Personal: haunted by a past mutiny; views strict codification as the cure for chaos.

**Complication (How they drive conflict):**
- Believes a public reading of the fragment will restore order—PCs must convince them the fragment is dangerous, negotiate an alternative, or stop a public reading that could be interpreted as coercive.

**Drama Point Trigger:**
- If players engage with Marlowe through a dignified ceremonial exchange (publicly respectful, honorably performed), Marlowe may reward them with 1 Drama Point or a temporary truce.
- If PCs stage a theatrical rebuttal that convinces Marlowe of a better solution, they may gain a reluctant ally.

**Suggested Proficiencies / Mechanics (system-agnostic):**
- Expert Leadership/Intimidation, trained Tactics, high Performance for public displays.
- Special ability: “Commanding Reading” — when Marlowe performs a public read, creatures within hearing must pass a Will/Audience check or be swayed by the spectacle (GM-controlled effect). This ability is mitigated if a consent ritual is performed concurrently.

**Secret or Plot Twist (Optional):**
- Marlowe privately supports decentralized consent clauses but publicly pushes centralization to prevent a worse faction from seizing control—open to persuasion if trust is earned.

**Roleplay Hooks / Uses for the PCs:**
- Antagonist who can become an uneasy ally if convinced.
- Source of a public spectacle that the PCs can use for diversion, negotiation, or dramatic showdown.
- Political lever: their support or opposition shifts Spindle Belt power dynamics.

**And remember, the safe word is _fiction_**
