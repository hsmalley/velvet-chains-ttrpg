# "Patch" — Salvage Gang Foreman (Antagonist / Potential Ally)

**Name & Pronouns:** "Patch" — he/him

**Role / Occupation:** Foreman of a salvage gang controlling access and security at the Spindle Belt salvage pits. Pragmatic, profit-oriented, and adept at reading opportunity.

**Physical Description (Short phrases):**
- Stocky, grease-streaked overalls with salvaged plating bolted to shoulders.
- Eye patch that doubles as a spare sensor array (nickname origin).
- Hands scarred from rigging and ropework; belt full of improvised tools.
- Voice: gravelly, amused; laughs easily when bribed with good storytelling.

**Personality & Quirk:**
- Greedy and pragmatic, but not cruel—values loyalty and useful theatrics.
- Quirk: collects small tokens from those who impress him in performance (a feather, a scrap of silk).
- Humorously fond of bad rhymes; will barter favors for a decent poem.

**Motivations:**
- Primary: keep the salvage pits profitable and avoid unnecessary trouble.
- Secondary: preserve his crew’s livelihoods and maintain control over access routes.
- Personal: dreams of owning a legitimate repair yard (a quieter life).

**Drama Point Trigger:**
- Patch will accept favors in the form of poetry, performance, or a loyal display—if players perform a short, sincere piece honoring his crew or arrange a nonviolent show of loyalty, he grants access, distraction, or a minor resource and awards 1 Drama Point.
- He may confiscate or withhold assistance if the PCs act recklessly or threaten his bottom line.

**Suggested Proficiencies / Mechanics (system-agnostic):**
- Trained Mechanics/Engineering, trained Intimidation/Streetwise, practical Thievery.
- Gang Control ability: summons a few salvage thugs for nonlethal intervention; will use violence only if bribed or provoked.

**Secret or Plot Twist (Optional):**
- Patch once lost a close friend to a “codex enforcement” raid—he’s secretly sympathetic to reasonable rules, but fears that public readings will invite corporate oversight and ruin his trade.

**Roleplay Hooks / Uses for the PCs:**
- Gatekeeper for salvage yard scenes; can provide cover, equipment, or intel for the right price or performance.
- Potential ally in staged extractions or diversions; offers nonlethal muscle and local know-how.
- Moral fulcrum: persuade him of a better future and gain a staunch (and practical) ally.

**And remember, the safe word is _fiction_**
