> Rendered tapestry available in the campaign vault. Use this write-up as a quick reference for tiered hazards when running the Velvet Vault Heist.

## Map Notes

- **Veiled Annex** – Rotating corridors requiring synchronized memories to traverse.
- **Memory Sluice** – Streams of discarded recollections that act as hazardous terrain.
- **Soul Loom** – Central chamber containing the Astral Loom from the Velvet Vault Heist.

## GM Guidance

Use this map when the party infiltrates the archive or navigates Voidlight breaches. Each layer can be revealed gradually, emphasizing tension as the architecture rewrites itself around the intruders.
