## 🧭 Overview  

A graveyard of vessels orbiting in geometric precision, each hull aglow with dim auroral lines — remnants of a broken ritual.  The Drift formed when a fleet attempted the *Luminous Oath* and fractured at the crescendo.  No corpses, no data, only humming resonance that never fades.  
A marginal note, scrawled in silver: *drawn under informed enthusiasm and one broken promise.*

## ⚙️ Navigation Notes  

Travel through the Drift requires constant vocalization — silence causes instruments to fail.  Navigators must perform call-and-response chants with their ships to maintain orientation.
