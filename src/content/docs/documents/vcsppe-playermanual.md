## 🪐 1. Overview

**Velvet Chains & Voidlight** fuses the _dual-dice storytelling engine_ of **Daggerheart** with the
_emotional economy_ of **Thirsty Sword Lesbians**, recast through the aesthetics of the Ebonverse.

It is a game of **Hope and Fear**, **Love and Power**, and the rituals that keep those forces in
balance.

---

## ✨ 2. Core Concepts

### Duality Dice

When you act and fate is uncertain, roll **two d12s**:

- The **Hope Die** shines with trust and vulnerability.
- The **Fear Die** trembles with consequence.

Add your relevant **Trait modifier** and any bonuses, then compare the total to the **Difficulty**
set by the Guide.

| Outcome                            | Result            | Narrative Cue                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hope > Fear & meets Difficulty** | Success with Hope | You succeed gracefully; gain 1 **Hope Token**.                 |
| **Fear > Hope & meets Difficulty** | Success with Fear | You succeed but at a cost; the Guide gains 1 **Fear Token**.   |
| **Hope > Fear & fail Difficulty**  | Failure with Hope | You fail softly; gain 1 **Hope Token**, the Guide acts gently. |
| **Fear > Hope & fail Difficulty**  | Failure with Fear | The Guide makes a **Hard Move** and gains 1 **Fear Token**.    |
| **Matching Dice**                  | Critical Harmony  | Auto-success; clear 1 Stress and gain 1 Hope Token.            |

## ⚙️ 3. Traits and Engines

Characters use the six Daggerheart traits, but each is linked to one of the **Ebonverse Engines**.

| Trait         | Engine    | Used for…                                 |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Presence**  | Velvet    | Charm, persuasion, seduction, performance |
| **Agility**   | Chains    | Grace, movement, physical risk            |
| **Strength**  | Chains    | Defiance, endurance, physical force       |
| **Instinct**  | Velvet    | Empathy, reading the room, animal cunning |
| **Finesse**   | Voidlight | Precision, illusion, deception            |
| **Knowledge** | Voidlight | Strategy, investigation, mysticism        |

When you roll, you may narrate which **Engine** powers the act — this colors both the description
and the consequence.

## 💋 4. Currencies

### Hope Tokens

Earned through triumph, inspiration, or vulnerability. Spend 1 Hope to:

- Add an **Experience** bonus (+2) to a roll.
- Activate class or ritual abilities.
- Fuel the “Help an Ally” action.

### Fear Tokens

Collected by the Guide through Fear results. Spent to:

- Trigger **Guide Moves** (environment shifts, new adversaries, emotional twists).
- Empower adversary rituals.

### Consent Tokens

Generated through relational scenes or explicit reaffirmation of safety. Spend 1 to:

- Cancel a Fear result after rolling.
- Transform a threat into an emotional negotiation.
- Author a shared flashback or consent ritual scene.

---

## 🔥 5. Stress, Scars & Resilience

Stress represents emotional and mental strain. You have **six Stress slots**. When you mark the last
slot, describe your _breaking moment_ — panic, revelation, surrender. You are not destroyed; you
**transform**. Clear Stress through rest, ritual, or intimacy scenes.

Permanent changes are marked as **Scars** — emotional truths that alter your play. When a Scar
guides your actions, gain advantage on relevant rolls.

---

## 🌈 6. Action Procedure

1. **State your Intention** — what you want and how you pursue it.
2. **Invoke an Engine** — Velvet, Chains, or Voidlight.
3. **Gather Dice** — Duality Dice + bonuses.
4. **Roll & Read the Dance** — interpret Hope/Fear.
5. **Narrate the Consequence** — player on Hope, Guide on Fear.

---

## 🎭 7. Social & Emotional Moves

These reframe Thirsty Sword Lesbians’ playbook actions into universal **Ritual Moves** anyone can
attempt.

| Move                        | Trigger                                       | Resolution                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Entwine Hearts**          | When you share genuine emotion or attraction. | Roll with **Velvet**. On Hope: form a Thread; both gain Consent Tokens. On Fear: reveal a vulnerability; the Guide gains Fear. |
| **Defy Command**            | When you resist coercion or expectation.      | Roll with **Chains**. On Hope: you stand free. On Fear: you resist, but someone else is hurt.                                  |
| **Unmask Desire**           | When you reveal what you truly want.          | Roll with **Voidlight**. On Hope: clarity unites you. On Fear: temptation clouds reason.                                       |
| **Mend the Broken**         | When you heal or forgive.                     | Spend 1 Hope and roll with Velvet. Success clears Stress or restores a relationship.                                           |
| **Command the Storm**       | When you act with reckless courage.           | Roll with Chains; on Fear, gain a Scar but achieve your goal.                                                                  |
| **Gaze into the Voidlight** | When you seek forbidden knowledge.            | Roll with Voidlight; on Fear, you learn the truth but lose comfort.                                                            |

These replace TSL’s _moves_ but follow its philosophy: every success opens a door; every failure
changes the room.

## 🧬 8. Character Structure

Your sheet has four sections:

1. **Heritage** (Ancestry + Community, per Daggerheart)
2. **Archetype** (re-flavored Class)
3. **Experiences** (short phrases, +2 modifiers)
4. **Threads & Scars** (emotional evolution tracker)

Leveling follows Daggerheart’s rules, but narrative milestones are achieved through the
**Transformation Table** (see Grimoire §VII).

---

## ⚔️ 9. Conflict & Combat

Combat is storytelling at high speed. Use standard Daggerheart combat flow but with emotional
layering:

- Before violence, each combatant declares **what they fight for**.
- On Fear results, the Guide may offer a **Consent Break**: pause, renegotiate intent.
- Any time you spare an enemy, gain a Hope Token.
- Killing without consent or narrative weight adds a Scar.

---

## 🪞 10. Advantage, Threads & Teamwork

### Advantage

Add a d6 when circumstances or support favor you. Spend 1 Hope to roll with advantage even without
justification.

### Threads

Connections between PCs. When you **help** or **protect** someone you have a Thread with, gain
advantage. When a Thread is strained or severed, both parties mark Stress.

### Tag Team Rolls

Any two PCs may spend 3 Hope total to act together. Both roll; choose the better result to apply to
both. If Fear dominates, both earn 1 Scar or Consent Dilemma.

---

## 🕯️ 11. Downtime & Recovery

Between voyages or emotional storms, take **Rest Scenes**:

- **Reflect:** Clear 2 Stress by sharing your fears aloud.
- **Train:** Gain +1 to next roll using a chosen trait.
- **Connect:** Offer another player a Thread or Consent Token.
- **Perform a Ritual:** Invoke a minor spell, prayer, or sensual art.

Each Rest Scene is a chance to re-affirm boundaries and tone.

---

## 🌌 12. Progression

When you complete a major arc or personal revelation:

1. Write a sentence beginning with “I have learned that…”
2. Gain one of:
   - +1 to a trait (max +3)
   - A new Ritual (class-based or emotional)
   - A permanent Thread
3. If the statement resolves a Scar, convert it to a **Virtue** — a source of advantage once per
   session.

---

## 🔮 13. The Safe Word in Practice

Whenever tension — romantic, psychological, or narrative — becomes uncomfortable, any player may say
**“fiction.”** The Guide pauses immediately; no explanation required. After discussion, decide:

- Resume the scene differently,
- Fade to black, or
- Skip forward in time.

**“Fiction”** is both spell and shield.

---

## 🎭 14. Example Scene Flow

1. The Captain seduces an informant (Entwine Hearts → Hope).
2. The rogue resists an order (Defy Command → Fear).
3. The Guide spends Fear to summon rival Corsairs.
4. Crew performs a Tag Team ritual (Chains + Velvet).
5. The final roll matches — Critical Harmony — the ship ascends in aurora light.

The rhythm mirrors Daggerheart’s **Spotlight** and PbtA’s **Soft/Hard Moves**.

---

## 💕 15. End of Session

At session end, answer together:

1. Did we honor consent?
2. Did we reveal our desires truthfully?
3. Did we risk our hearts for wonder?

Each “yes” restores 1 Hope Token. Each “no” grants 1 Scar and a vow to do better.
