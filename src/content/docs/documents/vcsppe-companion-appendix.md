## 🕯️ Ritual Framework

Every ritual has three phases:

1. **Opening Consent Oath** — participants state emotional or narrative stakes.
2. **Pulse Surge** — roll Duality Dice; interpret Hope/Fear.
3. **Mind Reflection** — narrate emotional impact, gain Hope or mark Stress.

Common Ritual Uses:

- Merge two Threads.
- Cleanse Fear Tokens via trust.
- Invoke divine or cosmic empathy.

## 🌈 Downtime & Recovery

| Action               | Effect                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| **Connect**          | Share a Thread or Consent Token with another PC.  |
| **Perform a Ritual** | Cast minor magic, prayer, or art scene.           |

## 🪞 Advancement: Transformation Table

When you would level up, instead choose one:

| Path          | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Confess**   | Speak a hidden truth aloud; gain new Ritual.   |
| **Forgive**   | Release resentment; clear all Stress.          |
| **Transcend** | Name and integrate a Fear; raise one trait +1. |

Mark this in your Codex as your **Evolution Statement**: _“I have learned that…”_

## 🎭 End of Session: Rite of Mirrors

At session’s close:

1. Each player praises one act of vulnerability from another.
2. Each acknowledges one discomfort or boundary moment.
3. Together say:
   > _“We see each other. We are fiction. We are free.”_

Then:

- Each player restores 1 Hope.
- The Guide clears 1 Fear.
- The group resets Threads as desired.

## 💕 Key Principles (Table Creed)

> **All drama is collaborative.** > **All boundaries are sacred.** > **No cruelty without consent;
> no silence without care.**

When uncertain, return to the Tri-Engine:

- **Velvet soothes** — lead with empathy.
- **Chains protect** — act with integrity.
- **Voidlight reveals** — speak truth to illusion.

## 🕯️ Codex Closure
