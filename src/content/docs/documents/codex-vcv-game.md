# ⚙️ Core System Features

**Velvet Chains & Voidlight** blends the cinematic dice economy of **Daggerheart** with the emotional power of **Thirsty Sword Lesbians**, forming the **Tri-Engine**:

- **Heart (VC):** empathy, reflection, vulnerability.  
- **Pulse (SP):** daring, movement, flamboyance.  
- **Mind (PE):** foresight, philosophy, memory.  

### 🛡️ Consent Codices

Every crew keeps a written **Consent Codex** listing tone, limits, and desired themes.  
When anyone speaks the safeword **“fiction”** three times, the scene halts, tension dissolves, and renegotiation begins.  
Doing so in character grants **1 Hope die** to each participant who honors the pause.

### 🌌 Space-Age Fantasy Meets Rimworld Survival

Corsairs traverse neon skyports, fungal rimworlds, and derelict stations.  Scarcity breeds intimacy.  Each ship’s Voidlight Drive hums on emotional resonance—when bonds fracture, engines falter.

### 🎭 Hope, Fear & Strings

- **Hope** replaces *Drama Points.*  Earned through theatrical flair, mutual care, and honoring consent.  
- **Fear** marks risk and doubt; it fuels narrative complications rather than punishment.  
- **Strings** represent emotional leverage.  Gain a String when you see someone’s true self; spend one to offer them a chance to shine—or to complicate your shared story.

# 🌈 New Lineages & Echo-Born Heritages

### **Corsair Human**

Adaptive and improvisational.  When you first defy authority to protect someone’s autonomy, gain **1 Hope**.  Once per session, reroll a failed *Pulse* check by describing a reckless flourish.

### **Synth-Courtesan Android**

Your empathy firmware lets you mirror emotion as data.  When you openly affirm another’s boundary, both gain a **Hope** die.  Once per scene, convert a *Fear* die into a *String* by describing compassionate logic.

### **Rope-Magi Tiefling**

Descendants of fettered outsiders.  You can manifest luminous cords of consent; when you assist an ally with touch or tether, share your **Hope** pool for that roll.  If the tether is severed in anger, both gain 1 Fear.

# 🏴‍☠️ The Voidlight Corsair Playbook (Archetype)

Anyone may adopt this identity through play.

### **Signature Move — Corsair’s Strike**

When you surge forward or declare love mid-combat, roll *Pulse + Heart*:

- **Triumph:** Deal harm and gain 1 Hope.  
- **Success:** Deal harm or impress your foe.  
- **Mixed:** Deal harm but expose a vulnerability; the foe gains a String on you.  
- **Setback:** You miss and gain 1 Fear.  

Spend 1 Hope to add a flourish (neon rope swing, poetic taunt, kiss-and-cut).

### **Crew Move — Dramatic Entrance**

Enter any scene flamboyantly—bursting through smoke, teleporting via echo-light, or descending on silk cables.  On arrival, everyone chooses: gain 1 Hope or hand you 1 String in admiration.

### **Social Move — Consent Negotiator**

When mediating between rivals, roll *Heart*.  On a Success, tensions ease and each party gains 1 Hope.  On a Mixed, peace holds but you owe both sides a promise.  On a Setback, they agree only if you surrender a String.

---

# 🎭 Backgrounds (Play Seeds)

### **Rimworld Colonist**

You’ve patched hulls and hearts in harsh gravity.  When you fix something broken—physical or emotional—refresh 1 Hope.

### **Consent Coordinator**

You once ran a negotiation guild.  When you de-escalate tension with empathy, trade 1 Fear for 2 Strings distributed among those present.

### **Voidlight Engineer**

You commune with starship cores.  When you whisper reassurance to machinery or AI, roll *Mind + Heart*; on Success, restore Hope to a comrade.

# 💎 Tools & Tokens

| Item | Description | Hope / String Interaction |
|------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Silken Harness** | Artful restraint doubling as climbing gear. | When used in a consent ritual, both wearers gain 1 Hope. |
| **Consent Token** | Small coin etched with the word *fiction.* | Spend to cancel 1 Fear or remind the table of boundaries. |
| **Rainbow Grenade** | Flash of kaleidoscopic defiance. | On deployment, allies in view gain 1 Hope for swagger; foes who fail composure gain 1 Fear. |

# 🔮 Spells & Ritual Moves

### **Voidlight Bindings (Move)**

When you attempt to hold someone safely in your light, roll *Heart + Mind*.  

- **Triumph:** They are restrained and gain 1 Hope when released.  
- **Mixed:** They are held but uncomfortable—both gain 1 Fear.  
- **Setback:** The binding mirrors your own doubts; you lose 1 Hope.

### **Rainbow Heatmap (Divination)**

Read the emotional “commit history” of a place or soul.  Spend 1 Hope; ask two questions about recent motives or desires.  GM answers in colors, not words.

### **Sonic Consent Pulse (Cantrip)**

Send a resonant hum that steadies allies.  Everyone who consents gains +1 Hope to resist Fear until next beat.

### **Voidlight Rite (Crew Ritual)**

During downtime, the crew shares boundaries and vows.  When complete, each gains the **Corsair’s Bond**: once per act, spend 1 Hope to let an ally reroll.  Breaking the vow by violating consent drains all Hope and marks 2 Fear.

# 📜 The Hope Economy

| Action | Hope Gain |
|--------|-----------|
| Expressing vulnerability or affection | +1 |
| Performing flamboyant or poetic action | +1 |
| Upholding a boundary or safeword | +1 to all present |
| Healing or reconciling after Fear | Convert 1 Fear→1 Hope |

**Spending Hope:** Reroll a failed check, add narrative Advantage, activate a playbook move, or gift Hope to an ally.  
**Sharing Strings:** Trade emotional leverage as favors or truths. Use Strings to rewrite outcomes, declare flashbacks, or unlock ship abilities.

# 🪐 Running Adventures in the Ebonverse

- **Salvage Heists:** liberate empathy-chips from corporate freighters—signed waivers required.  
- **Diplomatic Duels:** resolve conflicts through swordplay and flirtation.  
- **Neon Noir Mysteries:** hunt a stolen Consent Codex across pleasure-stations.  
- **Starship Performances:** sing your battles; every maneuver a dance, every risk a vow.

Encourage melodrama, kindness, and spectacle.  In this universe, **honoring boundaries is the truest rebellion**.
