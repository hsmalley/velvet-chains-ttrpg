## **Velvet Chains & Voidlight — The Game**

Welcome to the **Ebonverse**, corsair. You pilot a starship powered by emotion, cruise through
neon-lit debris fields, and swear oaths that matter more than any laser. This is a roleplaying game
built from the fusion of **Daggerheart’s Hope/Fear engine** and **Thirsty Sword Lesbians’ Strings
and Conditions**, tuned to a single rule:

> **Everything—love, battle, and discovery—operates by consent.**

---

## ⚙️ The Tri-Engine

The game runs on three intertwined currents:

- **Heart (Velvet Chains):** empathy, reflection, tenderness.
- **Pulse (Space-Pirate):** courage, spectacle, motion.
- **Mind (Prime Empathy):** reason, insight, foresight.

Every roll calls on one or more of these aspects. When you face risk, roll the appropriate Approach;
interpret results as Triumph, Success, Mixed, or Setback—each fueling Hope, Fear, or Strings.

---

## 🛡️ Consent Codices

Before a campaign begins, every crew writes a **Consent Codex**. It lists what themes are welcome,
what boundaries are firm, and how to signal discomfort. The sacred safe word is **“fiction.”** Speak
it three times to pause the scene, breathe, and renegotiate. When the table honors this pause,
everyone gains **1 Hope**.

---

## 🌌 The Ebonverse

Imagine _Firefly_ rewritten by queer poets and synth-witches. Neon skyports, fungal rimworlds, and
drifting ringworld monasteries pulse to the beat of Voidlight Drives—engines that hum with human
connection. When relationships fracture, so do the stars.

---

## 🎭 Hope, Fear & Strings

- **Hope** is your spark of trust and creativity. Earn it when you act with flair, empathy, or
  consent. Spend it to reroll, perform heroics, or protect someone’s dignity.
- **Fear** marks stress and doubt; it’s never punishment. The Guide spends it to twist the story or
  tempt transformation.
- **Strings** are emotional leverage—tokens of affection, guilt, attraction, or power. Trade them
  like promises; burn them to change someone’s fate.

---

## 🌈 Lineages of the Voidlight

**Corsair Humans** Raised among the Armada, you thrive on daring and adaptation. When you defy an
order for a moral cause, gain 1 Hope.

**Synth-Courtesan Androids** Social AIs built for connection. When you affirm someone’s boundary,
both gain Hope; when logic calms fear, turn that Fear into a String.

**Rope-Magi Tieflings** Descendants of the Plane of Fetters. When you tether yourself to an ally
during danger, share your Hope pool. If that trust breaks, each gains 1 Fear.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ The Voidlight Corsair Playbook

You can always become a **Voidlight Corsair**—a performer, pirate, and philosopher.

### Corsair’s Strike

When you move toward a foe or confession with reckless style, roll _Pulse + Heart._

- **Triumph:** deal harm and gain Hope.
- **Success:** harm or impress your foe.
- **Mixed:** harm but reveal a vulnerability; they gain a String on you.
- **Setback:** miss and earn 1 Fear.

Spend Hope to add flamboyant flourishes: rope swings, taunts, or declarations of desire.

### Dramatic Entrance

When you burst into a scene with spectacle—through smoke, portals, or spotlight—everyone chooses:
gain 1 Hope or hand you 1 String in admiration.

### Consent Negotiator

When you mediate between rivals, roll _Heart._ On success, tensions ease; both parties gain Hope. On
a mixed result, peace holds but you owe each side a promise.

---

## 🎭 Backgrounds

**Rimworld Colonist** — You patch what’s broken. Restore Hope when you repair body, hull, or heart.
**Consent Coordinator** — You’ve seen every negotiation. When you defuse tension with compassion,
exchange 1 Fear for 2 Strings. **Voidlight Engineer** — You whisper to machines. When you steady a
panicking AI or friend, roll _Mind + Heart_ to restore their Hope.

---

## 💎 Tools of the Trade

**Silken Harness** — doubles as climbing rig and ritual restraint. Using it in a scene of trust
gives both wearers 1 Hope. **Consent Token** — a carved coin etched with _fiction._ Spend it to
cancel one Fear or remind the table of safety. **Rainbow Grenade** — bursts in prismatic glory.
Allies who watch gain 1 Hope; foes who flinch gain 1 Fear.

---

## 🔮 Spells & Rituals

**Voidlight Bindings** — Roll _Heart + Mind_ to restrain someone safely. Triumph: they gain Hope
when released. Mixed: both gain Fear. **Rainbow Heatmap** — Spend 1 Hope to see the emotional traces
of a place. Ask two questions; the Guide answers in colors, not words. **Sonic Consent Pulse** —
Emit a soothing vibration. Willing allies gain +1 Hope to resist Fear until the next beat.
**Voidlight Rite** — A group ritual of boundaries and vows. When complete, each crew member may
spend 1 Hope per act to grant an ally a reroll. Breaking the vow drains all Hope and inflicts 2
Fear.

---

## 📜 The Hope Economy

You gain Hope when you:

- Act with dazzling style.
- Offer vulnerability or affection.
- Enforce or respect a boundary.
- Heal a wound, emotional or otherwise.

Spend Hope to reroll, aid allies, or trigger playbook moves. Convert 1 Fear to 1 Hope by
reconciliation. Trade Strings to influence scenes, claim narrative authority, or repair bonds.

---

## 🪐 Adventures of the Voidlight Armada

- **Salvage Heists:** liberate empathy chips from corporate freighters—signed waivers required.
- **Diplomatic Duels:** resolve disputes through swordplay and flirtation.
- **Neon Mysteries:** chase a stolen Consent Codex across glittering stations.
- **Starship Performances:** sing your battles; each maneuver a duet between trust and risk.

Remember: the true treasure isn’t plunder—it’s connection.

---

## 🎭 Table Principles

1. **Consent before plot.** No story is worth a broken boundary.
2. **Flair over efficiency.** Describe your moves; style earns Hope.
3. **Share the spotlight.** Give Strings generously.
4. **Fiction is the safe word.** Say it, honor it, and the voidlight glows brighter.

---

> **In consent we transcend; in drama we burn bright.**
