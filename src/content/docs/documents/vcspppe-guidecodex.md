> _“The Guide is not a god, but a mirror of tension — a keeper of Fear who makes space for Hope.”_

---

## 🪐 I. The Role of the Guide

You are the **Pulse**, the rhythm that keeps the story alive. Players weave desire and choice; you
provide consequence and momentum. You are not an antagonist — you are a **Consent Architect**.

Your calling is to uphold the three tenets:

1. **Collaborate, not control.**
2. **Tempt, don’t punish.**
3. **Turn Fear into beauty.**

When in doubt, ask: _“What serves the fiction, and honors consent?”_

---

## ⚙️ II. The Engine of Duality

All rolls create motion. Hope and Fear are your instruments; use them like a conductor.

- **Hope Results**: Reward vulnerability, reveal opportunity.
- **Fear Results**: Introduce risk, escalate emotion, or reveal truth.
- **Critical Harmony**: Celebrate; grant transformation.

You gain **Fear Tokens** when players roll Fear or fail dramatically. Fear Tokens are your creative
fuel — not a punishment pool.

Spend them to:

- Introduce a complication or rival.
- Unleash an adversary’s move.
- Make the environment respond with intensity.
- Trigger a **Drama Beat** (see below).

---

## 🔥 III. Drama Beats

Drama Beats are narrative sparks you can spend Fear to trigger. They echo _PbtA GM Moves_ but are
wrapped in Velvet Chains’ poetry.

| Beat                          | Cost   | Effect                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reveal a Secret**           | 1 Fear | Expose truth, memory, or temptation.                             |
| **Offer a Dangerous Choice**  | 1 Fear | Force a moral or emotional dilemma.                              |
| **Complicate a Bond**         | 2 Fear | Strain a Thread between PCs.                                     |
| **Invite a Rival**            | 2 Fear | Introduce someone with mirrored motives.                         |
| **Transform the Environment** | 2 Fear | Warp time, space, or psychic tone.                               |
| **Call a Consequence**        | 3 Fear | Demand payment for a past indulgence.                            |
| **Trigger a Consent Ritual**  | 3 Fear | Shift into a full scene of negotiation, intimacy, or revelation. |

After any Beat, hand spotlight back to a player and ask, _“What do you do?”_

## 💋 IV. Building the Session

Each session follows a rhythm of **Invocation → Escalation → Catharsis → Rest**.

### 1. Invocation

Open with imagery. Describe a sense before a sight. Invoke the Consent Codex — reaffirm safety,
tone, and shared themes.

### 2. Escalation

Raise stakes through emotion, not violence. Let Fear breathe; every token you spend must create
meaning.

### 3. Catharsis

Allow release — laughter, tears, forgiveness. Encourage players to narrate how their characters
physically feel the shift.

### 4. Rest

Use downtime scenes as interludes. Give every player a quiet moment to reflect or reconnect.

---

## 🌈 V. The Consent Codex in Practice

The Guide models consent by example.

1. **Pre-Session Safety**

   - Establish Lines & Veils, use the safe word _fiction_.
   - Invite each player to name a comfort signal (verbal or gesture).

2. **In-Scene Signals**

   - Ask before touch, even fictional: “Is it all right if this NPC reaches for your hand?”
   - Frame intimacy as ritual, not assumption.

3. **Aftercare**
   - Debrief after heavy scenes.
   - Ask: “Do we want to keep this tone next session, or shift?”

Consent is not paperwork; it’s worldbuilding ethics.

---

## 🧭 VI. Running the Duality Flow

Follow the Daggerheart flow of play:

1. **Set the Scene** — establish place, stakes, tone.
2. **Ask Questions** — players co-author world and motive.
3. **Invite Action** — call for rolls only when outcomes are uncertain.
4. **Interpret Hope & Fear** — narrate how the world changes.
5. **Pass the Spotlight** — let every player shine.

Keep the conversation organic — _drama is a dialogue, not an algorithm._

---

## 🧩 VII. Fear Token Alchemy

Fear is an energy economy. When you collect Fear Tokens:

- **1–3 Fear:** Small consequences or environmental tension.
- **4–6 Fear:** Emotional storms, relationship ruptures, public revelations.
- **7+ Fear:** Cosmic dissonance — the world itself trembles with withheld truth.

You can **burn all Fear Tokens** to trigger a **Crescendo**: a grand, cinematic event where the
environment externalizes emotion (storms, sirens, psionic auroras). Afterward, your Fear pool resets
to zero — the world exhales.

---

## 🪞 VIII. The Adversary as Mirror

Every adversary in Velvet Chains should personify a truth the heroes refuse to face.

- **Antagonists are not evil; they are unresolved desire.**
- When players destroy an enemy, ask: _“What part of yourself died with them?”_

### Creating an Adversary

1. Choose a **Domain of Temptation**: Power, Love, Knowledge, Freedom.
2. Assign **Hope / Fear Triggers** — what they inspire in others.
3. Give them **One Wound, One Want, One Worship.**
4. Always allow redemption — even villains crave consent.

Adversaries earn Fear Tokens when PCs reject or repress what they represent.

---

## 🎭 IX. Guide Moves (Quick Reference)

When in doubt, make one of these Moves:

- **Reveal hidden vulnerability** in an NPC or player’s ally.
- **Shift tone** from romance to tension, or vice versa.
- **Ask a question** that cannot be answered with violence.
- **Foreshadow a cost** the players aren’t ready to pay.
- **Echo a line** a player spoke earlier, now inverted by circumstance.
- **Invoke a ritual**, demanding participants reaffirm the safe word.

If you ever need structure, use _PbtA rhythm_: soft move → reaction → hard move.

---

## ⚔️ X. Conflict as Ceremony

Combat is still present but reframed as performance.

1. **State Desires** — every combat begins with intentions, not tactics.
2. **Trade Momentum** — use Hope/Fear results to advance the duel.
3. **Narrate Emotion First** — describe what it _feels_ like to strike or be struck.
4. **End in Choice, not Death** — offer surrender, forgiveness, or fusion.

Encourage cinematic choreography — swordplay as poetry.

---

## 💫 XI. Downtime & Transformation

Between voyages, let the world breathe.

Offer scenes that explore:

- Unspoken confessions.
- Reforging of Scars into art.
- Construction of safe spaces (literally or emotionally).

When a player evolves, update their sheet:

- Replace a Scar with a Virtue.
- Add a new Ritual.
- Redefine one Thread.

Let growth feel like healing, not leveling.

---

## 🔮 XII. Managing Tone

The Ebonverse is vast — tone control is essential.

| Tone Mode            | Description                              | Guidance                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Neon Gothic**      | Cyberpunk melancholy & sensual defiance. | Use rich imagery; reward rebellion.                 |
| **Space Opera**      | High drama among void-faring fleets.     | Spotlight theatrical vows and duels.                |
| **Mythpunk Romance** | Consent as magic, love as revolution.    | Slow down; treat intimacy as wonder.                |
| **Voidlight Horror** | Psyche versus cosmos.                    | Lean into Fear dice; emphasize the cost of knowing. |

Blend freely, but communicate shifts openly.

---

## 🧮 XIII. Calculating Difficulty

Use the Daggerheart logic:

- 10–12: challenging
- 13–15: dangerous
- 16–18: near impossible

Adjust by tone — in Velvet Chains, “dangerous” often means **emotionally risky**, not physically
lethal.

Encourage **player-led narration** on how they overcome challenges.

---

## 🌌 XIV. Ritual Scenes

Rituals are codified acts of transformation. They use the format detailed in `ritual.md` — three
phases:

1. **Opening Consent Oath** — players declare emotional stakes.
2. **Pulse Surge** — roll Duality Dice, interpret Hope/Fear.
3. **Mind Reflection** — narrate aftermath, consequences, empathy gained.

Every major story beat should culminate in a Ritual, not a resolution.

---

## 🕯️ XV. Ebonverse Campaign Arcs

Construct arcs using the framework in `arc.md`. Each arc should explore one **Consent Dilemma**:

- Can freedom exist without boundaries?
- Can desire survive without honesty?
- Is power ethical when shared willingly?

Weave Hope and Fear currents; track Consent Tokens as moral momentum.

---

## 💕 XVI. End of Session Ritual

At session’s end, lead the table in the **Rite of Mirrors**:

1. Each player names one moment of vulnerability they admired in another.
2. Each names one moment of discomfort or uncertainty.
3. The table says, in unison: _“We see each other. We are fiction. We are free.”_

Then clear 1 Fear Token and 1 Stress per participant.

---

## 🧠 XVII. Practical Tools

- **Session Zero Worksheet**: define Lines, Veils, Kinks, Themes.
- **Fear Ledger**: physical tokens or coins you can move visibly.
- **Drama Clock**: four segments — Calm, Tension, Crisis, Catharsis.
- **Thread Map**: use yarn or string to visualize relationships on the table.

Physical ritual enhances immersion — _make the metaphors tactile._

---

## 🪞 XVIII. Closing Philosophy

You are not here to control chaos. You are here to **curate emotion**. Fear is not an enemy; it is
an offering.

If a scene feels lost, return to the triad:

> _Velvet soothes._ > _Chains protect._ > _Voidlight reveals._

Everything else will follow.

---

## 🕯️ Codex Closure

> _“To guide is to love without possession, to reveal without cruelty, to let Hope and Fear share
> the same pulse.”_
