> _“Roll only when desire or danger reaches critical mass.”_

The Velvet Engine runs on three stats:

| Engine                 | Stat   | Core Domain                               |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Velvet Chains (VC)** | +Heart | empathy, reflection, consent              |
| **Space-Pirate (SP)**  | +Pulse | daring, charisma, rebellion               |
| **Prime Empathy (PE)** | +Mind  | intellect, foresight, pattern recognition |

Roll 2d6 + relevant Engine.

- **10+** — Triumph. You get what you want and hold 1 Hope.
- **7–9** — Mixed. Choose 1: gain Hope _or_ grant the Guide a String.
- **6-** — Setback. The Guide makes a move; mark a Condition or add 1 Danger.

### 💔 _Break a Bond_

When you reject someone who trusts you, roll +Pulse. On a 10+, sever cleanly but mark 1 Condition.
On a 7–9, both lose a String. On a 6-, the wound festers; the Guide marks 1 Danger.

Clear a Condition by performing the matching ritual:

- **SP:** reckless triumph or expressive art
- **PE:** introspection or mutual analysis
