> *“Roll only when desire or danger reaches critical mass.”*

The Velvet Engine runs on three stats:  

| Engine | Stat | Core Domain |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Velvet Chains (VC)** | +Heart | empathy, reflection, consent |
| **Space-Pirate (SP)** | +Pulse | daring, charisma, rebellion |
| **Prime Empathy (PE)** | +Mind | intellect, foresight, pattern recognition |

Roll 2d6 + relevant Engine.  

- **10+** — Triumph. You get what you want and hold 1 Hope.  
- **7–9** — Mixed. Choose 1: gain Hope *or* grant the Guide a String.  
- **6-** — Setback. The Guide makes a move; mark a Condition or add 1 Danger.

When you negotiate boundaries, vows, or intimacy (romantic, psychic, or tactical), roll +Heart.  

- **10+**: Both sides gain a Consent Token; erase one Condition each.  
- **7–9**: You reach agreement, but it costs you a String or a secret.  
- **6-**: Misunderstanding breeds tension; the Guide marks 1 Danger.

- **10+**: The act inspires all. Each ally gains +1 forward or clears a minor Condition.

- **6-**: The effort drains you; lose all held Hope.

---

### 🔮 *Consult the Mirror-Current*

When you meditate, commune, or perform a ritual to seek wisdom, roll +Mind.

## 💕 Support & Strings Moves

### 🤝 *Offer Hope*

When you comfort or inspire another, spend 1 Hope to give them +1 forward. If they act on your advice, gain a String on them.

### 🪐 *Spend a String*

When you pull on someone’s String, choose one:

- Add +1 to your roll against them.
- Ask them a question they must answer honestly.
- Offer them Hope to forgive a Scar.

### 💔 *Break a Bond*

When you reject someone who trusts you, roll +Pulse. On a 10+, sever cleanly but mark 1 Condition. On a 7–9, both lose a String. On a 6-, the wound festers; the Guide marks 1 Danger.

## 🌈 Conditions & Recovery

When you suffer emotional or physical harm, **mark a Condition** (e.g., Shaken, Longing, Overclocked).  
While marked, take –1 ongoing to relevant rolls until resolved.

Clear a Condition by performing the matching ritual:

- **VC:** honest confession or care scene  
- **SP:** reckless triumph or expressive art  
- **PE:** introspection or mutual analysis

## 🕯️ Consent Codex Move

When anyone at the table says the safeword **“fiction”**, pause play.  
Recalibrate, edit, or reframe the scene.  
Upon resuming, each participant gains 1 Hope for reaffirming consent.

2. Complicate a bond through honest emotion.  
3. Uphold a Consent Codex despite temptation.  
4. Perform a scene of theatrical courage or tenderness.
