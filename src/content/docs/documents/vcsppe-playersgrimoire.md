## 🪐 I. The Invocation of Play

Welcome, corsairs of consent and dream.  
Here within the **Ebonverse**, story and self entwine.  
When you play *Velvet Chains & Voidlight*, you are not simply rolling dice — you are performing **ritual empathy**.  
You are declaring: *I will choose drama over domination, curiosity over conquest.*

Every table is a ship; every player a constellation soul.  
Your Hope and Fear dice are not tools of chance — they are lovers in eternal orbit, seeking equilibrium.

---

## ✨ II. The Tri-Engine of the Ebonverse

All action flows through three engines: **Velvet**, **Chains**, and **Voidlight**.  
They are not stats but **temperaments**; each a way to touch the story.

| Engine | Element | Aspect | Questions it asks |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Velvet (Heart)** | Emotion | Compassion, attraction, creation | “Whom do you trust with your softness?” |
| **Chains (Pulse)** | Power | Devotion, defiance, survival | “What promise binds your strength?” |
| **Voidlight (Mind)** | Revelation | Mystery, intellect, change | “What truth are you brave enough to see?” |

These replace cold attributes with the heat of *intention*.  
When you act, you declare which engine you invoke and why — that *why* shapes the roll.

## 💋 III. The Consent Codex

Before any conflict or intimacy, invoke the **Safe Word: fiction**.  
This word is both boundary and blessing.  
When spoken, time halts; all players breathe; the story bows.  
The universe waits until consent is reaffirmed.  
To play this game is to **build trust as deliberately as worlds**.

You gain **Consent Tokens** whenever you:

- Express a vulnerability truthfully in-character.  
- Offer another player narrative agency over your scene.  
- Reaffirm consent during tension or intimacy.

Spend these tokens to:

- Cancel a Fear result.  
- Transform danger into dialogue.  
- Co-create a dramatic twist that honors all participants.

---

## 🔥 IV. The Duality Rite

When fate is uncertain, roll the **Duality Dice** — a d12 of **Hope** and a d12 of **Fear**.

- **Hope > Fear:** You succeed and the light grows.  
- **Fear > Hope:** You succeed, but consequence follows; the Guide gains Fear.  
- **Both fail:** The story turns, and the Guide performs a Move.  
- **Matching dice:** A **Critical Harmony** — the scene sings; clear 1 Stress and gain Hope.

Hope and Fear are lovers, not enemies; each asks you to narrate the cost of desire.

## 🎭 V. Roles at the Table

### Players — Corsairs of the Heart  

You are wanderers, rebels, and romantics.  
Your duty: to chase wonder, to court danger, to respect consent.  
You narrate not what you *can* do, but what you *dare* feel.

### The Guide — Keeper of the Pulse  

The Guide weaves consequence from Fear.  
They perform the world’s **Moves**, not to punish but to tempt.  
Their creed: *Reveal truth, offer choices, honor boundaries.*

---

## 🌈 VI. Bonds, Strings, and Threads

Relationships are the true map of this universe.  
Every connection is a **Thread** woven between two souls.  
When you share a secret, a kiss, or a duel, that thread brightens.

You may *pull a Thread* once per scene to:

- Gain advantage when protecting or defying that person.  
- Offer them a Consent Token.  
- Rewrite a memory between you through flashback.

If a thread is severed, both players narrate the emotional aftermath — a scar becomes a star.

---

## 🌌 VII. Transformation over Triumph

Leveling is not a staircase — it is a metamorphosis.  
When you would gain a level, instead choose one:

- **Confess** a truth that alters your self-image.  
- **Forgive** someone, including yourself.  
- **Transcend** a fear by naming it aloud.

This grants new Rituals, Hope, and narrative agency.  
Experience is measured not in numbers but in *mutual evolution.*

---

## 🕯️ VIII. The Ethic of the Table

- **All drama is collaborative.**  
- **All boundaries are sacred.**  
- **No cruelty without consent; no silence without care.**  

When conflict arises, pause.  
Ask, *“Is this the story we wish to tell?”*  
If yes, roll with passion.  
If not, invoke **fiction**, reset, and re-enter the dance.

---

## 🔮 IX. The Ritual of Beginning

When your crew first gathers, perform the **Rite of Names**:

1. Speak your character’s name and pronouns.  
2. Describe one hope that draws them to the stars.  
3. Offer one fear that could unravel them.  
4. Another player answers with a vow: *“I will see you through it.”*

The first Hope and Fear you name become your opening dice when the story begins.

---

## 🧩 X. The Promise of Velvet Chains

This is a world where power is chosen, not taken.  
Where seduction is a form of trust.  
Where rebellion is tenderness made radiant.

To play *Velvet Chains & Voidlight* is to practice the art of **consensual transformation**.

### 🕯️ Codex Closure
