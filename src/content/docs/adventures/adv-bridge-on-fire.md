# ⚔️ Bridge on Fire ✨⛓️🔥  
*"Every bridge remembers the hands that tied it."*  

---

## 🌌 𝘖𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸  
An orbital empathy-bridge connecting two colonies erupts into flame—fire without heat, woven from ruptured emotion.  
The Rope-Mage Guild calls for aid: the **Bridge’s heart** hums with disharmony, its cables glowing crimson as thousands of tethered travelers hang suspended in the vacuum corridor.  
The Knotless Guild claims responsibility, demanding the bridge be left to burn “so the Belt may breathe again.”  
The crew of *The Spindle Lass* must decide: repair the link, let it fall, or find a third way that honors both freedom and connection.

Act I opens with distress calls as the Belt glows red; Act II becomes an aerial ballet of zero-G rope work, diplomacy, and confession; Act III ends in a ritual fire where decisions rewrite the Belt’s empathy code.  
Success saves lives—and transforms the meaning of binding forever.

## 🔥 𝘛𝘸𝘪𝘴𝘵 𝘰𝘳 𝘌𝘤𝘩𝘰  
The “fire” is a physical manifestation of stored emotion from the *Knot of Remembered Breath*.  
Whichever side wins, the bridge becomes aware—it will remember the crew’s choice and appear in future arcs as a sentient structure.

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘈𝘵𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦  
Colors shift from indigo calm to molten gold.  
Gravity fluctuates; air tastes like sparks and salt.  
Music of tension cables becomes chorus as the bridge hums with collective emotion.
