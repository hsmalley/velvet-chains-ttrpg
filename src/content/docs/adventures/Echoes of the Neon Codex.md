**Estimated Playtime:** 1–3 sessions (modular).
**Tone:** Cyberpunk-pirate melodrama, flamboyant theatrics, consent-forward social play.

## Adventure Summary (Spoiler-light)
A stolen fragment of the **Neon Codex**—a Consent Codex used by corsair crews for dispute arbitration—has surfaced in the Neon Bazaar. The PCs are hired (or compelled) to retrieve or protect the fragment before a violent “interpretation” causes a diplomatic conflagration between rival corsair crews. Along the way they navigate neon markets, theatrical heists, and a coded love-letter ransom. Success can earn the crew allies, rare tech, Drama Points, and the favor of the Voidlight Armada.

---

## Adventure Beats (GM Roadmap)

1. **Hook & Briefing:** PCs learn of the Codex fragment at a neon bazaar negotiation lounge.
2. **Investigation:** Follow leads—tinkerers, street performers, data-divers.
3. **Complication:** A rival corsair crew tries to seize the fragment publicly during a ritual duel.
4. **Heist / Rescue / Diplomacy:** Multiple resolution paths (stealthy theft, staged performance, public legal arbitration).
5. **Climax:** Confrontation at the Spindle Belt's salvage pits or a dramatic negotiation on a ship's velvet-draped bridge.
6. **Aftercare & Consequences:** Reputation, allies, possible new Consent Codex clause.

---

## Hook Examples (Choose one)

- **Payment with Flair:** A Consent Coordinator named Lira offers a ledger of credits and a Drama Point per player to retrieve the Codex fragment discreetly.
- **Debt of Honor:** The PCs owe a favor to Captain Velvet; she tasks them to ensure the fragment never becomes a weapon for coercion.
- **Curiosity & Performance:** A street poet offers a festival pass and leads to the fragment if the party participates in a borough-wide performance competition.

## Key Locations

### Neon Bazaar — *Market District, New Zanshin*

- **Adventure Hooks:** Street performer witness, a data-broker stall, the Consent Lounge (where PCs can consult a mediator).

### The Spindle Belt Salvage Pits
- **Sight:** Glimmering tangled elevator cables, rusted hulks half-buried in mineral ash.

- **Drama Element:** A ceremonial “rope-tying” contest doubles as local dispute resolution—perfect for social play or distraction.

### Velvet Bridge (Ship)

## Scenes & Encounters

> Each scene lists goals, key checks (suggested DCs for level 3–5), complications, and Drama opportunities.

### Scene A — Consent Lounge Meet & Investigation
**Goal:** Learn who currently has the fragment and why.
**Key NPCs:** Lira Voss.
**Checks:**
- Diplomacy to extract info (DC 16).
- Society or Streetwise to read market rumors (DC 15).
- Stealth to tail a suspect (DC 17).
**Complication:** An impromptu performance contest interrupts the meeting—players must decide whether to join (gain Drama Points on high Performance) or hold their cover.
**Drama Opportunity:** Performing respectful, consent-focused improvisation nets 1 Drama Point and a public goodwill token.

### Scene B — Data-Broker Stall & Red Herring
**Goal:** Obtain a data fragment pointing to the Spindle Belt.
**Checks:**
- Crafting/Hacking to decrypt a ledger (DC 18).
- Bluff or Deception to buy info cheaply (DC 17).
**Complication:** The ledger contains a false trail; salvage gang watches PC actions.
**Drama Opportunity:** Instead of violence, offer a mediated exchange using a Consent Token—gains an ally or lowers price.

### Scene C — Spindle Belt Salvage Heist / Negotiation
**Multiple Approaches:**
1. **Heist (Stealth & Skill):** Infiltrate the salvage yard at night, bypass magnetic fields.
   - Skill checks: Stealth (DC 18), Thievery (DC 17), Engineering/Mechanics to bypass magnet (DC 19).
   - Encounter: Salvage guards (nonlethal preferred).
2. **Public Confrontation (Social):** Challenge Marlowe to a formal arbitration or Duel of Words on the Velvet Bridge.
   - Skill checks: Diplomacy (DC 19), Performance to sway crowd (DC 18).
   - Complication: Patch rigs the crowd to favor Marlowe unless persuaded.
3. **Staged Performance (Creative):** Orchestrate a theatrical extraction—distraction via a prepared show.
   - Skill checks: Performance (DC 18), Crafting to rig stage effects (DC 16).
   - Drama Point rewards: Award 1–2 Drama Points for truly theatrical, consent-centric execution.

**Consequences:** If PCs seize the fragment by force without honoring protocols, the Bazaar may shun them (loss of Drama Points, reputation). If they secure it through consent or theatrical arbitration, they gain allies and influence.

### Scene D — Climax on the Velvet Bridge
**Goal:** Resolve the Codex fate.
**Options:**
- Craft a new clause through negotiated ritual (Players + Lira + Marlowe; skill challenge: combined Diplomacy + Performance vs. set DC).
- Hand the fragment to a neutral body (e.g., Rim Monastery) in exchange for a boon.
- Use the fragment to trigger a Voidlight Rite (GM discretion) that binds crews for a season.

**Climactic Checks (suggested):**
- Group skill challenge: Combined check target 60 over 4 rounds using Diplomacy, Performance, Crafting, or Arcana.
- If negotiation fails, a dramatic nonlethal duel ensues—use social consequences rather than lethal outcomes.

---

## Loot, Rewards & Consequences

- **Physical Rewards:** Consent Token × 3, Silken Harness (minor mechanical benefit), salvage credits 300–1000.
- **Narrative Rewards:** Ally status with Lira or Marlowe, access to Bazaar resources, secret routes in Spindle Belt.
- **Drama Points:** Award 1 DP for key consent-driven resolutions; 2 DP for outstanding theatrical resolution; 0 DP if PCs ignored consent or coerced NPCs (GM discretion).
- **Longer-Term Consequences:** If PCs force an outcome, future Corsair crews may treat them as outlaws; if they broker a new codex clause, they gain reputation as consent architects.

## Player Handouts (Copy & Give)

**Handout — Consent Oath (short):**
> "We, present here, acknowledge our boundaries, our safe word **fiction**, and our will to engage only in mutual consent. Let theater guide our action; let respect bind our choices."

**Handout — Market Map (brief):**

- East Row: Data-Brokers & Silk Vendors (Lira’s Booth)
- West Stall: Salvage Brokers (Patch’s runner)
- Center Dome: Consent Lounge (mediations held here)

- **Poet's Duel:** Win a Performance contest to gain an audience and reduce a negotiation DC by 2.
- **Holo-forgery:** Forge a harmless replica of the Codex to distract Marlowe (Forgery DC 20).

---

## GM Guidance & Safety

- **Enforce “fiction” always:** Immediate pause, renegotiate scene boundaries. Never penalize a player for calling the safe word.
- **Tone check:** Keep romance implied and theatrical—avoid explicit sexual descriptions. Focus on negotiation, ethics, and dramatic stakes.
- **Drama Points as encouragement:** Use Drama Points to reward consent-centric solutions and theatrical creativity. They are player tools; encourage spending for cinematic moments.
- **Avoid punitive escalation:** If players choose coercion, make consequences social and narrative rather than lethal escalation—banishment, scorn, legal arbitration.

---

## Adventure Seeds to Continue the Campaign

- The negotiated clause is leaked—who profiteered from the leak?
- A corporate court issues a warrant for the PCs over "unauthorized codex interpretation."
- The Voidlight Engine awakens a forgotten clause in an ancient codex, altering interstellar marriage rites (plot hook for political intrigue).

---

## Quick Stat Suggestions (System-agnostic)
- **Negotiation DCs (medium):** 15–18
- **Skill Challenge Total (group):** 50–70 depending on level
- **Stealth/Heist DCs (hard):** 17–20
- **Pacing:** Allow 1–3 skill checks per major scene, with roleplay alternatives always viable.

### Closing Note
This adventure is designed for a table that celebrates theatricality and consensual play. Encourage players to make grand gestures, resolve conflicts with creativity, and use the safe word **fiction** whenever a boundary must be honored. May your Velvet Chains glint in neon and your stories echo across the Ebonverse.
