2. **Investigation** – Follow rumors through performers, data-divers, and tinkerers.
3. **Complication** – Captain Marlowe’s crew attempts a public seizure during a ritual duel.
4. **Resolution Paths** – Stage a heist, mediate a legal arbitration, or orchestrate a theatrical sting.
5. **Climax** – Confrontation at the Spindle Belt salvage pits or aboard the velvet-draped flagship.
6. **Aftercare** – Codify new consent clauses, secure allies, or brace for future political fallout.
