## Synopsis

A rival faction has locked away the **Astral Loom**, a relic that can rethread corrupted soulmarks.
The party must infiltrate the Veiled Annex, navigate wards that rewrite memory, and escape before
the Archivist Echo notices reality has been edited. The vault’s shifting corridors shimmer in three
hues — crimson for Heart, violet for Pulse, and silver for Mind — each representing a choice of
motive behind the heist.

## Act Structure

1. **Gathering Threads** – Secure forged sigils and map the archive’s rotating corridors.
2. **Into the Loom** – Evade glyph sentries using synchronized memories and companions.
3. **Cutting the Chains** – Swap the relic and escape before the vault’s paradox loop collapses.

## Hooks

- A companion’s corruption spirals unless the Astral Loom is recovered.
- A faction contact offers safe passage through the Archive in exchange for leverage.

## Rewards

- Access to the Astral Loom for future corruption downgrades.
- Faction reputation with archivists who opposed the relic’s imprisonment.

- **Tri-Engine Effect:** Consent Tokens earned during this heist may convert 1:1 into Hope dice or
  cancel one Fear token when spent to uphold mutual trust or emotional balance.

## Complications

- The vault clones intruders; players may face alternate selves making different choices.
- Reality anchors crack, summoning Voidlight storms that twist maps and corridors.

### GM Notes

Use countdown clocks to track the Archivist Echo’s suspicion. Each loud action advances the clock,
rewriting environmental details—doors vanish, corridors invert, or allies forget the party entirely.
