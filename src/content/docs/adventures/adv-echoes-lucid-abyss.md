## 🌌 𝘖𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸

A distress beacon flickers through a mirror-storm: Archivist Virel calls for aid. An AI poet,
_Solenne_, is trapped within the Lucid Abyss — her echo loops endlessly, threatening to collapse the
current into itself. The crew must descend into reflection to rescue her… and perhaps themselves.

## 🔮 𝘚𝘺𝘯𝘰𝘱𝘴𝘪𝘴

Storm-mirrors split the abyss into infinite corridors. Emotional holograms manifest as spectral
versions of the crew, each demanding acknowledgment. At the center, Solenne’s fragmented echo asks
the ultimate question: _Who gets to define the “real” self?”_

The “real” Solenne initiated the beacon; her reflection sent a test. Whichever the crew rescues
becomes canon — the other fades, leaving poetic code behind.
