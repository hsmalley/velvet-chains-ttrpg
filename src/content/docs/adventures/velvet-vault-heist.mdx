## Synopsis

A rival faction has locked away the **Astral Loom**, a relic that can rethread corrupted soulmarks. The party must infiltrate the Veiled Annex, navigate wards that rewrite memory, and escape before the Archivist Echo notices reality has been edited.

## Act Structure

1. **Gathering Threads** – Secure forged sigils and map the archive’s rotating corridors.
2. **Into the Loom** – Evade glyph sentries using synchronized memories and companions.
3. **Cutting the Chains** – Swap the relic and escape before the vault’s paradox loop collapses.

## Hooks

- A companion’s corruption spirals unless the Astral Loom is recovered.
- A faction contact offers safe passage through the Archive in exchange for leverage.

## Rewards

- Access to the Astral Loom for future corruption downgrades.
- Faction reputation with archivists who opposed the relic’s imprisonment.

## Complications

- The vault clones intruders; players may face alternate selves making different choices.
- Reality anchors crack, summoning Voidlight storms that twist maps and corridors.

### GM Notes

Use countdown clocks to track the Archivist Echo’s suspicion. Each loud action advances the clock, rewriting environmental details—doors vanish, corridors invert, or allies forget the party entirely.
