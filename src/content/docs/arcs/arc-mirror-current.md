## 🪞 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘴𝘦

Across the Ebonverse, new hyperspace phenomena called **mirror-currents** braid through void lanes —
living rivers of semi-sentient light reflecting intent, memory, and guilt. Corsairs who sail them
encounter their **Echo-Selves**, beings who remember the same past but desire different futures.

Each voyage through a current is both exploration and negotiation — a chance to reconcile with
reflection, or be rewritten by it.

## ✨ 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘦 & 𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘴

- **Surreal Cosmic Intimacy:** identity mirrored through hyperspace physics.
- **Romantic Cyber-Mysticism:** starlight as empathy, ships as mirrors.
- **Consent as Law:** no reflection manifests without permission.
- **Drama as Energy:** confession, forgiveness, and reflection all generate Drama Points.

## ⚙️ 𝘔𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘴 & 𝘕𝘦𝘸 𝘙𝘶𝘭𝘦𝘴

### 🎭 _Drama Points – Reflexive Fuel_

Earned through acts of honest self-revelation, forgiveness, or vulnerability. Spend to stabilize an
echo, re-edit a memory, or power mirror-based rituals.

### 💎 _Echo Tokens_

Physicalized fragments of potential selves. Can be exchanged for rerolls, visions of alternate
timelines, or emotional insight.

### ⛓️ _The Reflexive Rite_

Before traversing a mirror-current, the crew must recite:

> “I grant myself permission to change. I promise to remember that fiction is a mirror.”

Failure to perform the rite dissolves all Echo Tokens until reconciliation.

## 🪐 𝘒𝘦𝘺 𝘓𝘰𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴

### **1. The Obsidian Reef**

A reef of dark-matter mirrors orbiting a dead sun where memories are traded like silk. **Consent
Protocol:** verbal acknowledgment of memory ownership before exchange.

### **2. The Monastery of Reflected Hands**

Asteroid monastery of rope-magi who tie cords across mirrors to commune with future selves.

### **3. The Lucid Abyss**

A hyperspace corridor where every star is an eye. Ships here project emotional holograms as defense.

### **4. The Sanctuary of Soft Errors**

A data-asylum orbiting a dying moon where rogue AIs seek redemption via negotiated identity
rewriting.

### **5. The Prism Courts**

Floating tribunal over a gas giant judging crimes of _unconsented reflection theft_ — the
Ebonverse’s highest sin.
