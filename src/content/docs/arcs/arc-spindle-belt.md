## 🧭 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘴𝘦  

Around the fractured moon of Tessera-9 drifts the Spindle Belt: a ring of colonies linked by silk cables and shared breath.  
Rope-magi sail between them, weaving literal lines of empathy called **bond-threads**—bridges that transmit emotion faster than light.  
But a new faction, the **Knotless Guild**, preaches freedom from all ties.  
The Armada must decide whether connection is salvation or shackle.
