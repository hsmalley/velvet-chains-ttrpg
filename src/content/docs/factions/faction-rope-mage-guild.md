# 🪢 The Rope-Mage Guild ✨⛓️🔥  
*"Every knot is a promise, every bridge a confession kept."*

## 🧭 𝘖𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘯 & 𝘐𝘥𝘦𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘺  
Long before the Belt was colonized, miners learned to anchor ships with silk cables spun from vacuum-grown filament.  
A few of them—poets, engineers, dreamers—noticed that when they tied cords while breathing together, the cables vibrated in tune with empathy.  
They became the first **Rope-Magi**, teaching that physics and feeling could share the same tension.  
The Guild now maintains the empathy web that holds the Belt together.  
Their creed: *“To bind is not to own, but to remember.”*

## 🕸️ 𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 & 𝘚𝘺𝘮𝘣𝘰𝘭𝘴  
- **Hierarchy:** Guildmistress → Circle Masters → Apprentices → Chordlings (initiate weavers).  
- **Symbol:** A golden infinity loop knotted at its heart.  
- **Colors:** Gold and indigo—threads of day and night entwined.  
- **Consent Codex:** Every knot must be tied by two hands; solo binding is considered hubris.

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 & 𝘌𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴  
Guild members gain Drama when they **create trust through craftsmanship**—repairing bridges, teaching patience, or tying reconciliation knots.  
They lose Drama if they bind without permission or use cords to restrain.  
The Guild’s paradox: connection requires tension; too much slack and bonds drift apart, too tight and they suffocate.

## 🧩 𝘗𝘭𝘰𝘵 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴  
1. **The Frayed Bridge:** a damaged empathy line between stations hums a distress chord; only a ritual of apology can retune it.  
2. **The Apprentice’s Trial:** Lior disappears with forbidden thread said to weave destiny itself.  
3. **The Knotless Challenge:** Emera Quinn offers a debate duel—cut or tie—the outcome could sway the Belt’s ideology.

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘈𝘵𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦  
Their stations are cathedrals of cord and light.  
Air tastes faintly of ozone and honeyed metal.  
Every corridor thrums with soft tension; each knot on the wall is a prayer answered.

- **Allies:** Voidlight Armada, Sanctuary of Soft Errors.  
- **Rivals:** The Knotless Guild.
