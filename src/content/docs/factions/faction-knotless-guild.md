## 🧭 𝘖𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘯 & 𝘐𝘥𝘦𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘺

Born from the trauma of a collapsed empathy bridge, the Knotless began as a philosophical response
to grief. When the _Seventh Bond_ snapped and hundreds suffocated tethered together, a survivor
named **Emera Quinn** declared that dependency was the true vacuum. From her teachings rose the
Knotless Guild — a federation of free-floaters who believe all attachments, emotional or material,
weaken autonomy. They see the Belt’s woven web as a prison disguised as affection.

Their motto: _“Better to drift alone than to drown together.”_

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 & 𝘌𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴

The Knotless gain Drama through _sincere detachment_—acts that end codependence cleanly. They lose
Drama when they form new attachments or manipulate connection under false pretense. Their paradox:
every time they free someone, they feel the tug of belonging to that freedom.

**Moral Dilemma:** Can one consent to isolation?

## 🧩 𝘗𝘭𝘰𝘵 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴

1. **The Severed Hymn:** The Guild plans to cut the last tether to the Belt’s central station. PCs
   must decide whether to stop them or learn from them.
2. **The Untier’s Funeral:** Emera Quinn requests a memorial that requires every attendee to leave
   one bond behind.
3. **Echo of the Knotless:** A reflection of a Guild member appears aboard the _Spindle Lass_,
   claiming to seek reattachment.

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘈𝘵𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦

Sparse corridors, no handholds. Their stations smell of ozone and absence. Music is forbidden; only
silence and breath permitted. Visitors report hearing the heartbeat they’ve forgotten to share.
