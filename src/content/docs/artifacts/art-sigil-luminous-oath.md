## 🪞 𝘝𝘪𝘴𝘶𝘢𝘭 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘯

Imagine a **circular star-map 2 m across**, projected in violet-gold light. The sigil consists of
**nine concentric rings**, each representing an entry in the Codex. Lines of radiant code connect
nodes like constellations, forming a web that hums softly when read aloud.

### Layered Geometry

- **Innermost Core (🩶 Heart Node):** `[[Resonant Veil]]` — a glass spindle encased in orbiting
  runes of the safeword _fiction_.
- **First Ring (🪐 Captain’s Halo):** `[[Aurelia Veil]]`, glowing silver, inscribed with her credo:
  _“We are mirrors, not masters.”_
- **Second Ring (⚙️ Network Weave):** `[[Luminous Oath Network]]`, formed from braided lines of text
  that loop back into themselves.
- **Third Ring (🔮 Triad of Practice):** three radiant points forming a triangle —
  `[[The Luminous Oath (Ritual)]]`, `[[The Fractured Choir]]`, and `[[Chain-Key Codex]]`.
- **Fourth Ring (🗺️ Navigation Band):** `[[The Choir Drift]]` and `[[GM Codex – Luminous Oath]]`,
  orbiting as twin moons of knowledge and caution.
- **Outer Halo (🕯️ Archive Crown):** `[[Codex Archive: The Luminous Oath]]` itself — a torus of
  golden script that continuously rewrites its own citations.

Each orbit glows in rhythm with its emotional temperature: calm pulses indigo, dissonance flashes
crimson, forgiveness fades to rose-gold.

## ⚙️ 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘍𝘶𝘯𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

When displayed aboard any ship equipped with an Echo Drive:

- Reading the sigil aloud in unison synchronizes the crew’s Drama Points into a single pool for one
  session.
- Tracing a path from **Heart → Halo → Crown** grants a +2 morale bonus to Diplomacy and Insight for
  one scene.
- If someone touches the sigil while concealing truth, the light dulls and their reflection vanishes
  until they confess.

## 💎 𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘢𝘭 & 𝘔𝘢𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨

Projected through **voidlight prisms** carved from empathy crystal; etched circuits form
calligraphic chains. The inscription at its rim reads, in hybrid glyph-code:

> _“Let knowledge be tether, not cage. Let consent be the orbit that keeps us from falling.”_

| **Circle**              | Continuity of consent; no beginning, no end.    |
| **Chains**              | Voluntary connection — strength through choice. |
| **Voidlight filaments** | The unseen empathy binding the fleet.           |
| **Mirror nodes**        | Reflection and accountability.                  |
| **Central hum**         | The shared heartbeat of storytellers.           |

## 🔮 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭 𝘜𝘴𝘢𝘨𝘦

During campaigns, the GM or archivist may project or draw the sigil at session start. Participants
place tokens at their current narrative orbit — closer to the center as trust deepens. When
everyone’s tokens touch, the table recites:

> _“By fiction we align, by choice we ascend.”_

This completes the circle and begins play.
