## 🪐 𝘗𝘶𝘳𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘦  

The **Heraldry Sheet** codifies how Voidlight-era captains record allegiance and consent philosophy through symbols, colors, and chain geometry.  
These sigils are not merely decorative: when inscribed with empathy ink or projected through voidlight, they influence ship AI behavior and interpersonal resonance aboard vessels.

## 🧬 𝘏𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘪𝘤 𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦  

Each corsair’s sigil-banner includes three layers:

1. **Core Glyph:** represents personal consent principle (e.g. ⛓️ for commitment, 🪞 for reflection).  
2. **Crown Hue:** chosen emotional tone for current voyage.  
3. **Orbit Seal:** a miniature emblem of faction or ship.  

Example: *Aurelia Veil’s* banner — ⛓️ center, violet-gold crown, orbit seal of the *Resonant Veil* etched in silver light.

## ⚙️ 𝘏𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘳𝘺 𝘜𝘴𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘙𝘶𝘭𝘦𝘴  

- **Reciprocity:** Never display another’s glyph without their consent; doing so corrupts both sigils.  
- **Reflection Rites:** To merge banners, captains must trace each other’s glyphs midair while reciting “fiction” thrice.  
- **Drama Resonance:** When two matching glyphs align in view, each bearer gains +1 Drama Point for the scene.

## 🎭 𝘈𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘢𝘯 𝘗𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦  

Voidlight tattooists are both engineers and poets.  
They weave these glyphs into crew skin using empathic nanodust; the ink glows when the bearer feels safe.  
Forgers can mimic appearance, but never resonance — the counterfeit always flickers out of rhythm.
