## 🪞 𝘔𝘪𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘎𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳

You are not a judge; you are a mirror. Your role is to reflect player intention with respect,
amplify theatrical flair, and guard the table’s emotional safety.

**The Prime Tenets:**

- Every scene is a negotiation.
- Every revelation is reversible through consent.
- Every triumph is brighter when earned through empathy.

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘗𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘵 𝘔𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵

### 🎲 𝘎𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢

Award 1 Drama Point when a player:

- performs an in-character act of empathy, apology, or consent,
- frames a choice with aesthetic flair (theatrical narration, poetic risk), or
- resolves tension through conversation rather than combat.

### 💫 𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢

Players may spend a Drama Point to:

- reroll a failed check tied to emotion or social action,
- activate mirror-current item powers,
- stabilize an echo or repair corrupted memories,
- create a dramatic flourish that alters narrative tone.

### 🧮 𝘓𝘪𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘴

Each player may hold a maximum of 3 Drama Points. Unused points dissolve at dawn (or narrative
chapter close).

## 💎 𝘌𝘤𝘩𝘰 𝘛𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘯 𝘊𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦

| Phase             | Description                                        | GM Cue                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Manifestation** | A player faces a mirrored version of themselves.   | Ask: _“What truth would your echo demand?”_ |
| **Negotiation**   | Player defines boundaries, GM embodies reflection. | Keep tone curious, not punitive.            |
| **Resolution**    | Echo fuses, departs, or remains companion spirit.  | Grant Echo Token or Drama surge.            |

**Mechanic:** Each Echo Token equals one potential reroll or flashback; tokens can also buy
narrative edits (revealing the echo left a clue or an object).

## ⛓️ 𝘙𝘶𝘯𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘴

Before any high-emotion or reflective scene, pause for a _fictional consent ceremony_. Use language
like:

> _“The storm stills; each of you speaks your name and intention. Say ‘fiction’ aloud if you wish to
> proceed.”_

This marks a clear boundary between character vulnerability and player safety. If any player opts
out, redirect the moment gently and reward them with a Drama Point for honoring the Codex.

## 🔮 𝘕𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘗𝘢𝘤𝘪𝘯𝘨

**Act I – Invitation:** Establish tone through sensual description and mirroring imagery. **Act II –
Confrontation:** Introduce moral paradoxes or alternate selves. **Act III – Integration:** Resolve
through empathy or surrender. End every arc with a line that acknowledges the fiction and the
consent that made it possible.

## ⚔️ 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘵 𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘝𝘪𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦

Violence in Mirror-Current stories should express inner conflict. Replace “attack rolls” with _acts
of expression_: a debate, a dance, a duel of light. Let mechanical rolls represent emotional risk
rather than hit points.

## 🪐 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘎𝘔’𝘴 𝘓𝘦𝘹𝘪𝘤𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

| Term               | Meaning                         | Example                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Mirror Current** | Hyperspace of living light.     | “Your ship hums with mirrored breath.”          |
| **Echo Self**      | Quantum reflection of a person. | “They remember your choices differently.”       |
| **Consent Codex**  | Sacred oath of boundaries.      | “The Codex glows when promises are true.”       |
| **Drama Surge**    | Group-wide catharsis.           | “Every heart at the table shines for a moment.” |

Use this lexicon as a tone compass.
