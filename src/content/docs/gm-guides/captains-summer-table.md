### 📜 𝘕𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘨𝘢𝘵𝘰𝘳’𝘴 𝘕𝘰𝘵𝘦  
Keep this table on your bridge or GM screen.  
Each column is a compass direction:  
- *Tone* guides performance.  
- *Mechanic* guides play.  
- *Theme* guides emotion.  
- *Drama* guides safety.  
- *Phrase* guides ritual.

Whenever a new arc joins the Armada, add a row and etch its safe word in the margins.
