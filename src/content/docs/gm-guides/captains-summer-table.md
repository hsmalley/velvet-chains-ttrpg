### 📜 𝘕𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘨𝘢𝘵𝘰𝘳’𝘴 𝘕𝘰𝘵𝘦

Keep this table on your bridge or GM screen. Each column is a compass direction:

- _Tone_ guides performance.
- _Mechanic_ guides play.
- _Theme_ guides emotion.
- _Drama_ guides safety.
- _Phrase_ guides ritual.

Whenever a new arc joins the Armada, add a row and etch its safe word in the margins.
