# ⚙️ The Luminous Oath — GM Codex ✨⛓️🔥  

*"A captain’s compass for empathy and drama."*

## 🧭 𝘔𝘪𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯  

To frame cosmic consent not as bureaucracy but as art.  
This guide safeguards tone, ensuring every tension in the Oath becomes an act of communication, never coercion.  
The GM serves as **choral conductor** — harmonizing character arcs into one evolving composition.

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘔𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵  

Award Drama Points for:  
- Players voicing boundaries in-character.  
- Transforming hostility into humor.  
- Acts of forgiveness that change scene outcomes.  

Spend Drama to:  
- Add sensory splendor (light flares, resonance ripples).  
- Invoke ship or faction powers like *Echo Drive Surge*.  
- Trigger “flashback negotiations” to reframe consent before a risky act.

## 💎 𝘔𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘤 𝘔𝘰𝘥𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘦𝘳𝘴  

- **Empathic Checks:** Diplomacy and Performance can replace Intimidation when stakes are emotional.  
- **Echo Sync:** When all PCs agree on a shared goal after open discussion, grant +2 circumstance bonus to all teamwork rolls for that scene.  
- **Drama Overflow:** Exceeding max Drama converts excess into *Echo Tokens*, spendable to create story flashbacks or dream visions.

## 🕯️ 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘙𝘪𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭 𝘗𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦  

Encourage a brief check-in phase:  
> *“State your boundary, your curiosity, and your color.”*  
Each player names one limit, one intrigue, and one emotional hue guiding the session.  
Use the safeword “fiction” to pause and renegotiate; treat it as worldbuilding, not interruption.

---

## 🔮 𝘕𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘗𝘢𝘤𝘪𝘯𝘨  

The arc follows the rhythm of a hymn:  
1. **Verse:** Discovery of trust.  
2. **Refrain:** Doubt or betrayal.  
3. **Coda:** Renewal of consent and identity.  
Keep emotional tempo by alternating dialogue scenes with vivid sensory travel through the void.  

---

## ⚔️ 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘵 𝘔𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘴  

Favor non-violent duels:  
- **Mirror Dances:** choreographed empathy tests.  
- **Debate Orbits:** verbal sparring in micro-gravity.  
- **Echo Games:** opponents swap memories until truth surfaces.  

---

## 🪞 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘦 & 𝘓𝘦𝘹𝘪𝘤𝘰𝘯  

Use language of light, music, and reflection.  
Avoid militaristic jargon; emphasize collaboration and art.  
Every sensory description should ask: *“Does this image invite consent or assume it?”*
