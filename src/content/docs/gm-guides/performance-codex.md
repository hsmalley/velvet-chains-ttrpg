## 🧭 𝘗𝘶𝘳𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘦  

The Performance Codex teaches crews (players) how to transform intention into expression.  
Every rule of the Velvet Chains system becomes alive only when spoken, moved, or mirrored — this is its kinetic scripture.

| Mode | Symbol | Function | Table Technique |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Flair (Heart)** | ❤️‍🔥 | Visual or vocal flourish that adds emotion. | Describe sensory detail; reward with Drama. |
| **Negotiation (Pulse)** | 💕 | Dialogue of consent before action. | Quick “safeword checks”; reward with safety. |
| **Reflection (Mind)** | 🪞 | Post-scene analysis; empathy debrief. | Quiet narration or journaling; reward with Echo Tokens. |

Each session should breathe in this rhythm: *Flair → Negotiation → Reflection → repeat.*

Narrative pacing mirrors musical phrasing:  

1. **Overture:** Establish motif — introduce emotional stakes.  
2. **Dissonance:** Conflict or miscommunication emerges.  
3. **Resolution:** Boundaries reaffirmed, empathy deepens.  

Encourage tonal variation: let players *solo* (spotlight scenes) then rejoin the ensemble.

## 🪐 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘖𝘧 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢  

Before major rolls or scenes, crews may recite:  
> *“Fiction first, feeling second, fairness forever.”*  

This resets emotional alignment and signals the shift from play to ritual.

| Ritual | Purpose | Action | Effect |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Mirror Check** | Emotional safety | Each player gestures a circle over heart | Halts escalation, grants pause. |
| **Drama Pulse** | Energy boost | Clap once, inhale together | Restores 1 shared Drama Point. |
| **Echo Closure** | Scene end | All players speak one word describing feeling | Locks emotion, prevents bleed. |

- **Lighting:** soft color shifts mirroring crew emotions.  
- **Music:** adaptive ambient with rising harmonics during consent declarations.  
- **Language:** avoid command imperatives; use invitations (“would you,” “may I,” “shall we”).

The Captain is facilitator, not tyrant.  
Their power is *direction through attention*.  
They earn Drama not by control, but by spotlighting others.  
Each act of generosity adds one invisible “Harmony Point,” usable to narrate miracles once per campaign.
