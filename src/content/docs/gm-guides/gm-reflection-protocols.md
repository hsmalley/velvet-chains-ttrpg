## 🧭 Mission

To help storytellers manage reflective narratives without losing emotional balance. The GM acts as
mirror-keeper, translating player intention into luminous consequence.

---

## 🎭 Drama Management

- Award Drama Points when players describe emotions, not actions.
- Encourage consent-based flashbacks.
- Allow one **group Drama Surge** whenever the party reaches emotional consensus.

---

## 💎 Mechanic Modifiers

Echo Token interactions grant +1 to Insight rolls when players verbally declare safe words
in-character. When in doubt, trade mechanics for meaning.

---

## 🕯️ Consent Ritual Practice

Before intense roleplay:

> “Repeat after me — fiction is our mirror, and we choose to see kindly.”

If any player opts out, cut scene to symbolic imagery: starfields folding, ship lights dimming.
Reward honesty with Drama.

---

## 🔮 Narrative Pacing

- Act I: Invitation & Wonder
- Act II: Confrontation with Reflection
- Act III: Forgiveness or Fusion

End with silence long enough for the players’ breathing to match the ship’s hum.

---

## ⚔️ Conflict Models

- _Mirror Duel:_ opposed Performance or Diplomacy, damage = catharsis.
- _Reflection Debate:_ Will saves to maintain composure.
- _Embrace Sequence:_ mutual Drama expenditure = emotional repair.
