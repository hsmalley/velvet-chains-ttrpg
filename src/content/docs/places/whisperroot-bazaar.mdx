## Atmosphere

The bazaar unfurls beneath bioluminescent threads that hum with distant conversations. Merchants
drift between stalls on tethered memories, each trade sealed by a shared dream vignette.

## Key Entities

- **Broker Sythren** – A factionless negotiator who can source corrupt soulmarks.
- **Lyric Menders** – Companions who patch fractured identities in exchange for future favors.
- **Echo Criers** – Rumor mongers broadcasting timelines that might happen.

## Secrets & Hooks

- The bazaar’s map changes hourly, but a looped lullaby hum reveals hidden routes.
- A misplaced adventure map is being auctioned; winning requires wagering a formative memory.
- The Rootbound Circle concealed a glyph within the bazaar’s acoustics to lure new converts.

## Using the Bazaar

Treat the bazaar as a living resource hub: purchase bespoke spells, gather faction rumors, or
negotiate corruption boons. Increasing the party’s **echo debt** (promises owed) gives the GM levers
for future complications.
