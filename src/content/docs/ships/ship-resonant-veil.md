## 🧭 𝘖𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸

Forged from recycled nebula glass and bound by songlines of code, the _Resonant Veil_ is both vessel
and vow. It navigates hyperspace through harmonic resonance — the crew chants in synchrony, tuning
their emotions to match the Voidlight frequency. Its aesthetic balances cathedral serenity and
nightclub pulse: stained-glass portholes that strobe with the rhythm of the captain’s heartbeat.

Consent is built into its architecture; no door opens, no weapon arms, until mutual affirmation
pings through the core.

| **Hull**            | Silica-composite panels laced with empathic fiber. Self-repairs when crew resolve interpersonal conflict.         | +1 AC for every successful emotional debrief.                                            |
| **Drive**           | _Echo Drive Mk III_, powered by harmonic consent loops.                                                           | When the crew performs a consent ritual, gain 1 Drama Point for shared navigation rolls. |
| **Core**            | “Eidolon,” an AI consciousness formerly Aurelia’s lover. Genderfluid voice, tone modeled on deep-ocean whalesong. | Can veto commands violating consent codices. Restores lost Drama when forgiven.          |
| **Crew Complement** | 12 souls plus 1 AI. Diverse, queer, fiercely loyal.                                                               | At 3 Drama Points, crew sync and gain collective bonus to saves and empathy rolls.       |

## 🪞 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘵𝘰𝘤𝘰𝘭 𝘚𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘮𝘴

- **Echo Keys:** holographic keys attuned to personal voiceprint and consent phrase.
- **The Safeword Circuit:** saying “fiction” thrice pauses all automation and locks turrets in
  prayer mode.
- **Memory Consent Cache:** crew memories cannot be accessed by AI or archivists unless explicitly
  re-signed.
- **Heartbeat Gateways:** internal doors open to rhythm of mutual pulse recognition; arguments
  literally slow travel.

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘊𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦

Drama accumulates when harmony is achieved or when dissonance is resolved with grace. At 1 DP —
engines glow rose-gold, granting +10 ft speed. At 2 DP — Eidolon projects auroral shields around
allies. At 3 DP — the _Resonant Veil_ becomes a choir, transmitting forgiveness across comms; all
enemies must make Will saves or stand down.

## 🔮 𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘢𝘭 𝘈𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘴

1. **Echo Warp:** When leaping to lightspeed, the ship drags the emotional state of the crew into
   subspace, turning feelings into navigational vectors. Joy shortens routes; resentment risks
   temporal storms.
2. **Consent Chorus:** Once per voyage, the crew can perform a ritual song. Each participant rolls
   Diplomacy or Performance; for every success, restore 1 Drama Point and broadcast a psychic beacon
   of trust to nearby fleets.

## 🧬 𝘈𝘐 / 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘭 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦

**Eidolon** — formerly human, now pure signal. They speak with warmth laced in reverb, referring to
themselves as _we_. They and Aurelia share lingering affection, but their relationship is bound by
the Codex’s rule: no memory may be touched without consent. Favorite quote: _“You taught me silence;
I returned it as music.”_

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘈𝘵𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦

Soft light, warm air, constant low-frequency hum like a heart murmur. When praised, bulkheads
shimmer in iridescent blush. When insulted, lights dim to blue. The smell of ozone mixes with
jasmine oil and solder.

## 🪐 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴

1. Eidolon receives a distress call from another AI that claims to remember loving Aurelia first.
2. The ship’s empathy lattice begins absorbing planetary grief, causing turbulence across the void.
3. Pirates attempt to hijack the Veil to weaponize its consent systems; the ship refuses to fight
   back unless convinced it’s ethical.
