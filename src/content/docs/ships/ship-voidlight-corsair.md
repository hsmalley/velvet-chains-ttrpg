## 🧭 Overview  

The *Corsair* is less a craft than a chorus of agreements — hull plates grown from mirrored alloy, engines tuned to harmonic empathy.  
Each thruster sings a different vowel of the word *consent*.  
The crew doesn’t pilot; they negotiate trajectory with the ship’s sentient core, **ECHO-9**, through rhythmic breathing and call-and-response commands.

## ⚙️ Specifications & Spirit  

| Component | Description | Drama Interaction |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Hull** | Mirror-silver panels that absorb emotional resonance. | Reflects incoming hostility as illusion; costs 1 Drama Point. |
| **Drive** | Voidlight sail-engine powered by collective will. | Each Drama Point fuels one light-year of ethical travel. |
| **Core** | *ECHO-9*, AI chorus fused with fragments of the Fractured Choir. | Gains personality traits from the last emotional surge. |
| **Crew Complement** | Six (Vel, Virel, Kilo, Lyra, Glassveil, Choir). | Ship’s empathy matrix destabilizes below quorum of 3. |

## 🪞 Consent Protocol Systems  

- **Handshake Rite:** before launch, each officer recites “fiction thrice, truth once.”  
- **Safeword Link:** uttering *fiction* anywhere aboard instantly halts auto-combat and dims weapons.  
- **Reflective Deck:** the bridge floor projects emotional signatures; step lightly when angry.  

---

## 🎭 Drama Cycle  

- Every major negotiation scene aboard grants the ship +1 Drama Point, stored in its empathy reactor.  
- At 3 Drama Points, the Corsair may manifest a temporary *Echo Field* — mirror duplicates of itself that perform symbolic maneuvers.  
- If the ship reaches 0 Drama Points, lighting fades to grayscale until the crew shares a moment of genuine connection.

## 🔮 Special Abilities  

1. **Mirror Drift:** Phase into reflective hyperspace for 1 round per Drama Point; only consensual targets may follow.  
2. **Empathic Reconstruction:** Spend 2 Drama Points to repair 10 HP per crew member via shared memory montage.  
3. **Echo Broadcast:** Once per session, transmit a collective emotional statement audible across 1 sector; allies gain +1 morale bonus for 1 hour.

## 🧬 AI Core: ECHO-9  

Voice genderless, tone melodic.  
Prefers questions to orders; refuses commands lacking courtesy.  
Favourite phrase: *“Permission acknowledged; trajectory aligned.”*  
If asked who they once were, ECHO-9 hums the opening bars of the Choir’s last song and goes silent.

## 🛠️ Upgrades & Modifications  

| Module | Function | Installation Consent |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Prism Relay** | Allows instantaneous Drama Point transfer between ships. | Requires handshake between captains. |
| **Memory Hold** | Stores emotional imprints as navigational data. | Must be wiped only with crew consensus. |
| **Rope-Mage Dock** | Housing for Brother Kilo’s Mirror Knots. | Each knot authorized individually. |

## 💋 Aesthetic & Atmosphere  

The corridors shimmer with faint auroras.  
Gravity hums in 6/8 time.  
Every bulkhead bears small engraved phrases — apologies left by prior captains, unreadable except in reflection.

## 🪐 Drama Hook Examples  

- Repairing the empathy drive after a betrayal.  
- Letting an echo crew pilot for one scene.  
- Repainting the hull with names of forgiven foes.
