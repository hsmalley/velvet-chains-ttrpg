## 🌌 Preface

The final chorus of the Fractured Choir accompanied our exit. Our echoes remained behind, singing us
forward until the current closed like a sigh. For one instant, every memory we’d ever hidden glowed
on the ship’s hull.

## 🎭 Drama Resolution

All Drama Points spent in reflection restored as Empathy Credits. Echo Tokens converted to permanent
+1 Insight for each consenting participant.

## 🪞 Observation

The mirror left residue—silver script across the Corsair’s prow reading: _“You were kind.”_ I have
ordered it left unpolished.

---

## 🧭 Navigator’s Note

Future captains: always end the voyage with gratitude. The currents crave acknowledgment more than
sacrifice.
