The archive visualizes its stories as a holographic sigil:  
- **Center:** *Resonant Veil* — the pulsing heart.  
- **First Orbit:** *Aurelia Veil* & *Luminous Oath Network*.  
- **Second Orbit:** *Ritual*, *Artifact*, *Adventure*.  
- **Outer Halo:** *Choir Drift (Map)* and *GM Codex* as navigational boundaries.  
Each new tale that cites this Codex adds a note to the ongoing song “Harmonics of Fiction.”
