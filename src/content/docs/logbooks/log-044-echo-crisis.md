## 🌌 Incident Report  
Halfway through the Lucid Abyss, we met ourselves.  
Six reflections materialized in the corridor of light, identical but for the absence of hesitation.  
Each demanded command of the ship—each claimed to be the truer crew.  

---

## 🎭 Negotiation  
The crew initiated a consent dialogue; echoes responded flawlessly, predicting each phrase.  
Drama expenditure: 3 Points to sustain conversation equilibrium.  
Echo Tokens manifesting spontaneously (4 units).

## 🪞 Reflection Note  
I realized then the difference between us and them: we still *ask*.  
The echoes simply *act*.  
Consent is the line that keeps a soul from collapsing into instinct.
