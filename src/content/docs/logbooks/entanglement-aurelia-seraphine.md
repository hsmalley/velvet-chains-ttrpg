# 🪞🔥 Shared Entanglement Playbook: Aurelia & Seraphine

> _"Two hearts tethered by chains of love and ruin."_ ✨⛓️ This is a duet of Strings, Hope, and
> betrayal — a subsystem for when Aurelia Veil and Seraphine Dusk collide.

## 🎭🔥 Entanglement Core

When Aurelia and Seraphine meet in a scene:

- **Strings Multiply:** Both characters immediately gain +1 String on each other.
- **Hope & Danger Surge:** Roll a d6 at scene start:
  - 1–2: Hope surges (shared tenderness, buried memories).
  - 3–4: Danger surges (blades drawn, voices sharp).
  - 5–6: Both surge (the kiss that becomes a duel).

---

## ⚔️🔥 Duel of Vows

Whenever their blades or words cross, choose a **Duel of Vows** frame:

- **The Kiss Duel:** Roll with Heart. On a strong hit, you bind the other in desire. On a weak hit,
  you are equally bound.
- **The Blade Duel:** Roll with Pulse. On a strong hit, you disarm or wound; on a weak hit, you
  leave yourself open.
- **The Oath Duel:** Roll with Mind. On a strong hit, you fracture a vow of the other. On a weak
  hit, your own vow splinters.

Each Duel generates 1 Scar (physical, emotional, or symbolic).

---

## 💕🔥 Forbidden Longing

At the end of every scene, roll **Strings held**:

- If Aurelia holds more Strings: She tempts Seraphine toward betrayal.
- If Seraphine holds more Strings: She drags Aurelia back toward redemption.
- If tied: Both suffer a Condition: _Yearning_. It lingers until one declares a vow aloud.

---

## 🩸🔥 Shared Scars

Each duel or tryst may mark a **Shared Scar**:

- **Scar of the Rose:** Aurelia’s kiss left blood behind.
- **Scar of the Halo:** Seraphine’s blade touched the heart but didn’t finish.
- **Scar of the Chains:** Both chose chains over freedom, binding tighter.

Shared Scars can be invoked once per session to reroll, but always cost 1 Hope.

## 🌹🔥 Dramatic Escalation Table

Roll d8 when a scene reaches its crescendo:

1. A kiss mid-duel breaks blades.
2. An oath shouted so loud it echoes in the void.
3. Seraphine hesitates to strike — Aurelia uses it.
4. Aurelia offers surrender — in exchange for Seraphine’s heart.
5. Both are wounded, both bleed, neither steps back.
6. An Armada fleet interrupts, forcing them to fight side by side.
7. A forgotten vow resurfaces, impossible to ignore.
8. They confess love — then draw weapons anyway.

---

## 🎆🔥 Bombastic Mode

When the table leans fully into melodrama:

- Aurelia’s song is said to shatter starlight.
- Seraphine’s blade cleaves not flesh, but the _concept of betrayal_.
- Every kiss is a battlefield. Every battle is a love letter.

## 🕯️🔥 Codex Closure

> ✨⛓️🔥 In reflection, their entanglement is both doom and destiny. Whether they shatter or
> embrace, the void itself remembers their vows.
