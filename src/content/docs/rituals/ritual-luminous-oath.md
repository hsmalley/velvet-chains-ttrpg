# 🔮 The Luminous Oath ✨⛓️🔥  

*"Magic is consent shaped into pattern — and sung into propulsion."*

## 🪞 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  

Crews gather in orbit where voidlight refracts through their hulls.  
Each participant touches the ship’s core glass and whispers a truth they fear.  
Light bends around them, forming ribbons of shared resonance.  
At the ritual’s peak, every heart syncs to a single beat audible across the fleet — a chorus of sincerity that can be picked up on subspace frequencies for centuries.

## 💀 𝘍𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘶𝘳𝘦 & 𝘉𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘩  

If mistrust taints the final chant, the resonance fragments — the ships drift apart in hyperspace, emerging days or decades later with warped memories.  
Each participant loses 1 permanent Drama Point capacity until they perform forgiveness rites.
