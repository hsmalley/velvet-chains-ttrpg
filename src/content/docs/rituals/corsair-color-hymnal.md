# 🌈 Corsair Color Hymnal ✨⛓️🔥  

*"We sing the spectrum so the void may know our tone."*  

---

## 🪞 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  

The Hymnal is a living score projected in waves of light.  
When read aloud, each color radiates a frequency that stabilizes ship systems and emotions alike.  
Crews perform it before negotiations, voyages, or when harmony falters.  
No instrument required — breath, rhythm, and intention suffice.
