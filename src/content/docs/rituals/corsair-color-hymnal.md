## 🪞 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

The Hymnal is a living score projected in waves of light. When read aloud, each color radiates a
frequency that stabilizes ship systems and emotions alike. Crews perform it before negotiations,
voyages, or when harmony falters. No instrument required — breath, rhythm, and intention suffice.
