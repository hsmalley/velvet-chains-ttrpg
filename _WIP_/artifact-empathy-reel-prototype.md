# 💎 The Empathy Reel Prototype ✨⛓️🔥  
*"It turns compassion into traction."*  

---

## 🧰 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  
A waist-high reel of gleaming cable mounted to a glassy spindle core.  
Every strand hums faintly with tone-mapped emotion; the device measures not horsepower, but *heartforce.*  
When two or more crew crank in synchrony, the reel emits a low chord that strengthens cables and mends frayed trust.

## ⚙️ 𝘔𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘴  
| Trait | Effect |
|-------|---------|
| **Usage** | Requires at least two willing participants. Each must declare an intention aloud. |
| **Frequency** | Once per encounter or per voyage segment. |
| **Duration** | 10 minutes of sustained effort. |
| **Effect** | Converts emotional resonance into physical aid: repairs 10 HP of structural damage to ships or bridges per participant. If a disagreement is resolved during operation, repair doubles. |

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  
- Each participant may spend 1 Drama Point to increase efficiency by 25%.  
- When all participants share a declared feeling, the Reel stores **1 Bond-Thread**, usable later to stabilize emotional hazards.  
- If someone attempts to operate it while withholding emotion, cables seize and emit a discordant shriek (minor psychic backlash).

## 🔮 𝘓𝘰𝘳𝘦 & 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴  
1. Built by **Master Tress** and **Caldera** as the first step toward an *Empathy Engine* for inter-station travel.  
2. The Knotless Guild claims the device enslaves workers to their own compassion and seeks to dismantle it.  
3. Rumors tell of a second prototype that wound itself too tightly—its reel still spinning somewhere in orbit, humming with bottled sorrow.

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘚𝘺𝘮𝘣𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘮  
Polished brass veined with luminous thread; when empathy surges, the filaments glow like veins of dawn.  
It smells faintly of copper and saltwater tears.  
The rhythm of its spinning is often used as metronome during the Belt’s communal songs.

> The dock trembles; cables fray.  
> “All together!” cries Tress.  
> Hands grip the Reel, breath syncing with spin.  
> The ship steadies, and the hum becomes harmony.  
> For a moment, the Belt itself seems to exhale.
