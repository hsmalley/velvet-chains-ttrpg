# 🚀 The Spindle Lass ✨⛓️🔥  
*"Every knot is a promise, every sail a shared breath."*

## 🧭 𝘖𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸  
The *Spindle Lass* is an inter-orbital freighter woven from rope-steel and faith.  
Her hull flexes like woven silk; her rigging hums mantras of balance.  
Each voyage through the Belt’s debris fields is part meditation, part choreography: the crew ties literal cords between outposts, forming the **Empathy Web** that keeps the colonies from drifting apart.

## 🪞 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘵𝘰𝘤𝘰𝘭 𝘚𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘮𝘴  
The Lass cannot launch until every crew member ties a *Consent Knot* at their station.  
Each cord glows once the wearer speaks their intent for the journey.  
If any knot loosens during flight, *Caldera* pauses all thrust and softly asks, “Who needs to retie what was taken for granted?”

## 🧬 𝘈𝘐 / 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘭 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘦: Caldera  
A loom spirit manifesting as a warm voice through the rigging.

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘈𝘵𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦  
Interior smells of ozone and linen.  
Gravity oscillates with engine rhythm, so laughter ripples through corridors.  
When calm, ropes hum like a heartbeat; when fearful, they tighten protectively.

## 🪐 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴  
- The crew’s web begins humming a forgotten melody—an old vow seeking renewal.  
- Caldera refuses to untie a broken knot, claiming it belongs to the Captain’s echo.  
- A rival ship offers to merge webs; the consent negotiation could unite or unravel the Belt.
