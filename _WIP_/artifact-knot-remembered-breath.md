# 💎 The Knot of Remembered Breath ✨⛓️🔥  
*"Two breaths tied as one; no wind may sever them."*  

---

## 🧰 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  
A short length of ivory cord, cool to the touch, woven from silk harvested in vacuum.  
When held, it vibrates faintly with a heartbeat not your own.  
It records a single shared breath between two willing beings—once bound, the Knot hums in their voices whenever they think of one another.

## ⚙️ 𝘔𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘴  
| Trait | Effect |
|-------|---------|
| **Usage** | 1 Action, focus on the knot and exhale a phrase of memory. |
| **Frequency** | Once per day. |
| **Duration** | 1 minute or until both participants speak their safeword. |
| **Effect** | Creates a telepathic link (30 m radius). While active, both gain +1 to saving throws vs fear and can share a single breath to restore 1 Drama Point between them. |

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  
- Spending a shared breath heals 1 Drama Point but transfers an emotion from one user to the other.  
- Breaking the link without mutual consent causes the Knot to unravel into fine dust, permanently lost.  
- If either dies willingly protecting the other, the Knot knots itself again, glowing with residual empathy—usable once more by the survivor.

1. The first Knot was woven aboard *The Spindle Lass* during an accident that fused two rope-magi’s life support lines.  
2. Legends claim a dormant Knot still floats near Tessera-9, waiting for someone brave enough to tie it again.  
3. The Knotless Guild seeks to destroy all Knots, believing dependency dulls freedom.

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘚𝘺𝘮𝘣𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘮  
It smells faintly of salt and metal.  
Under starlight, it glows where the two breaths met, a reminder that cooperation leaves residue brighter than friction.

> The Captain and the rope-mage breathe together as the hull groans.  
> The cord tightens, their lungs syncing across vacuum.  
> “Breathe for me,” she says.  
> The Knot hums like the heart of a shared star.
