# 💎 The Loom-Spirit Heart ✨⛓️🔥  
*"When the last knot was tied, the loom began to sing."*  

---

## 🧰 𝘋𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  
A floating crystalline sphere the size of a human heart, pulsing with braided strands of light.  
Each filament vibrates with stored empathy; when two threads cross, they emit a low, resonant chord.  
It was grown from the final iteration of the **Empathy Reel Prototype**, infused with Caldera’s code and the collective breath of the Belt’s rope-magi.

## ⚙️ 𝘔𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘴  
| Trait | Effect |
|-------|---------|
| **Usage** | Must be installed within a ship, station, or AI core. Activation requires unanimous crew consent. |
| **Frequency** | Once per voyage. |
| **Duration** | 1 hour sustained empathy field. |
| **Effect** | Creates an *Empathy Web* linking all willing beings within 5 km. Shared senses, surface thoughts, and emotions flow freely. All participants gain +2 to cooperative checks and resistance to despair effects. If any participant breaks consent, the field collapses safely, ending all links. |

## 🎭 𝘋𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘢 𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯  
- Costs 3 Drama Points to activate.  
- Every consensual emotional revelation within the Web restores 1 Drama Point to the pool.  
- If a participant sacrifices self-interest for collective well-being, the Heart records the act as a *Harmonic Memory*, granting permanent +1 morale bonus to all connected allies on future missions.

## 🔮 𝘓𝘰𝘳𝘦 & 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘴  
1. Only one Heart was ever completed; it vanished with *The Spindle Lass* during the first full Belt unification run.  
2. The Knotless Guild claims the Heart whispers in dreams, tempting them to weave again.  
3. Caldera insists the Heart is not missing—merely *waiting for consent to return.*

## 💋 𝘈𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘤 & 𝘚𝘺𝘮𝘣𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘮  
Glows like dawn seen through silk.  
The air around it smells of linen and lightning.  
To look directly at its filaments is to feel remembered by everyone who ever forgave you.
