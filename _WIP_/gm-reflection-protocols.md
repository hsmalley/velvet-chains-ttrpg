# ⚙️ GM Reflection Protocols ✨⛓️🔥  
*"Run the mirror, don’t force the image."*  

---

## 🧭 Mission  
To help storytellers manage reflective narratives without losing emotional balance.  
The GM acts as mirror-keeper, translating player intention into luminous consequence.  

---

## 🎭 Drama Management  
- Award Drama Points when players describe emotions, not actions.  
- Encourage consent-based flashbacks.  
- Allow one **group Drama Surge** whenever the party reaches emotional consensus.  

---

## 💎 Mechanic Modifiers  
Echo Token interactions grant +1 to Insight rolls when players verbally declare safe words in-character.  
When in doubt, trade mechanics for meaning.  

---

## 🕯️ Consent Ritual Practice  
Before intense roleplay:  
> “Repeat after me — fiction is our mirror, and we choose to see kindly.”  

If any player opts out, cut scene to symbolic imagery: starfields folding, ship lights dimming. Reward honesty with Drama.  

---

## 🔮 Narrative Pacing  
- Act I: Invitation & Wonder  
- Act II: Confrontation with Reflection  
- Act III: Forgiveness or Fusion  

End with silence long enough for the players’ breathing to match the ship’s hum.  

---

## ⚔️ Conflict Models  
- *Mirror Duel:* opposed Performance or Diplomacy, damage = catharsis.  
- *Reflection Debate:* Will saves to maintain composure.  
- *Embrace Sequence:* mutual Drama expenditure = emotional repair.
