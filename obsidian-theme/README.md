# Velvet Chains & Voidlight Obsidian Theme

This Obsidian theme mirrors the neon corsair palette used on the Velvet Chains codex site. Install it when you want your vault to glow with Voidlight gradients.

## Installation

1. Copy the entire `obsidian-theme` folder into your vault’s `.obsidian/themes/` directory (renaming it to `velvet-chains-voidlight` keeps things tidy).
2. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Appearance → Themes → Manage** and enable “Velvet Chains & Voidlight”.
3. Optional: toggle **Transparent window** in the appearance settings for extra glow, and enable the **Style Settings** plugin to tweak accents, glow, and background animation.

The theme is designed for dark mode. Combine it with the campaign templates and keep the safe word **fiction** on standby.
